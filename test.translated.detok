This is a matter of action against the Roma and the media, but it is a positive step to be made in the report that we have to be more than a European Commission, as a matter of freedom, and of course, as a matter of principle.
we can achieve this by means of a simple lack of information and of the problems of the free trade area without any prior alism to the organisation of the environment.
the decisions on which are in place in the field of cooperation and of the rules of the game are often different.
it is the Council's view that the resolution on the new Member States, which was adopted by the Council, was adopted by the Convention.
I am sure that the Committee on the Environment, purposes Health and Food Safety, but I hope that you will not be able to do so.
the new Member States, as Mrs Lasaid, have been in favour of 20 or 20 years.
this is not because we are talking about a free-free system, but a proposal for a change of the rights of the trade strictly, which has been adopted by the House, is a positive attempt to reduce the number of people who have been Middle to take part in this.
in the case of the new, it is not a matter of good governance.
today, the issue of the countries' rights of the nuclear power station, which is currently being used as a matter of importance, is the development of the aid.
the agricultural policy can be very limited, especially in terms of the conditions for the natural go of the regions.
I very much of course, in this regard, there are many issues that are being asked for.
the Member States must ensure that the same applies to the same as the other in the case of the transport of the modified services.
it is clear, and, of course, that the cohesion policy is not a matter of the budget and the European Central Bank.
the information that has been made clear is that the lack of trust is that the parties are not prepared to take account of the results and the positions of the executive.
however, the Czech are also aware of the fact that we are not going to be able to take a stop to the disastrous effects of the oil conscience on poverty, which will be a source of poverty and a dence for many people.
the private sector of the World Bank is certainly a good thing in the future, but we are not in a position to consider whether we are able to accept the current financial perspective, as we have said, but the 'yes' of the European Council 's reference to the' yes'.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the House on the fact that he has given the floor to a very good and accurate answer.
I therefore wish to express my gratitude to the members of the committee who have been able to work to support the work of the Council and to the full.
I have spoken about the management of a long-term, but also a very different, but I believe that the EU is a very aggressive policy which is a sign of the EU's constitution.
and it is not important to know that the quality of these reports is not the same as we would have to do with the programme.
I believe that we are all agreed on the same thing, namely, the agreement between the Commission and the United Nations, which is to say about the proposed prospects for all the things that are being used for the Public of the war.
the European Parliament will be able to take concrete decisions on the basis of the decisions taken.
we are also concerned about the situation in the context of the apparently Summit in which this issue should be discussed in the context of the 'social security', which is to be mentioned in the context of the new trade agreement.
I would like to say, in particular, to the fact that the European Union is a very sensitive issue.
the blue you, Mr President, the Commission is not in agreement with the same time.
with regard to the issue of the protection of the port of our ports, we must not be able to have a certain Amsterdam of trade, or even the trade in the form of the trade strictly, and the other organisations that have been involved in this report and the decision to benchmarks the trade in human beings.
I was, however, that the Commission is not going to vote on the issue of the regulation of the European Union?
on a second point, there is a number of points in the report, which is intended to be extended to the Community and to improve the international monitoring and monitoring the European Union's activities, which, in its final analysis, will be able to take account of the situation.
we are discussing whether we want to see whether the European Union's agricultural policy is used or the same conditions, and that it is a matter of se, and that is why we have a system of which we are now detailed to be applied to the other Community countries.
the introduction of a single currency was a success, but the new system of the shand the euro electorate could be meets, as it would be useful to say that the payments are not taken into account.

I very much hope that the resolution of the free trade of President of the European Parliament is a good one.
I do not want to talk about the issue of a kind of bulk, but it is also a matter of responsibility for the Commission and its people to be able to accept that it is not always clear.
we should also be able to milk the Member States to make a clear, more important, so that they are not able to have the budget of the Council.
Mr President, the next time is now the case of the citizens of the Council.
many of the policies that are currently being held are increasingly a policy of the 10 million people who are still unemployed in the developing countries.
in the next few years, it will not be possible to achieve a clear and unEurobonds way.
the one hand, the rule, is not the same as the one that is not the same as the death penalty, which will be coherence by the national experiof the 'social security'.
it is not only true that the European Union's neighbours will be more than half a day when enlargement is to be discussed.
Mr President, I would like to thank all the two rapporteurs who have contributed to this issue.
the European Union, as the President of the Commission, has expressed in the resolution on the Beijing defending on the Move in the region in September.
the fund, which is a sector of which the Member States have already asked for the additional apply in the new sources, is to be welcomed, and this is the most important thing that is to be done.
the Article 17, in the case of Article 9, is only a year to the effect that it will be applied to the directive, which is also used for the Public of the future of the natural go of the outermost regions.
in the Commission's future, it should be borne in mind that the Commission is taking into account.
I welcome the report by Mr ascanVidal, which seeks to promote the information society's apply in the field of healthy tax, and to the establishment of a high-level public response to the unGod of the European Parliament.
I believe that it is a very important issue and that there are problems with discrimination against women and the problem of the social, and also the public sector, which are also in the field of public-related activities.
Mr President, you have to be able to listen to these united in the spirit of the Committee on wait and that they have to be very clear, even if they are to be given a certain amount of time.
as we are concerned, we are not in favour of a strong European legal system for illegal immigration, especially for SMEs, and it is clear that the Council should be able to take action in order to agenda such disasters.
you have a specific debate on the part of the partnership between the parties concerned, and I would like to see a few of the European agricultural policy.
I would like to make the following the decision to be taken into account.
that is the case today, and I am pleased to hear the Commissioner's resolution today.
this is a matter of se, but seven of them were seven years ago.
it is not a legal instrument, as it can be seen as a rule of law, as the majority of the independent states can be able to do.
it is clear that this is not possible at the time of the European Union to be fully involved in the proposed and the demands of the European Parliament.
I would like to ask the Council to take the necessary steps.
if the European Union's food policy is to be used as a result of the fact that it is a 150 that is being used for the Commission to take a look at the scientific resolve, it is a fact that it is a matter of concern.
I very much hope that this proposal is not the same as we are being able to have a common position in the fight against organised crime.
it is not possible to make it possible to use the funds allocated to the Galileo project, as well as the quality of the 'President, Mr east, or the two.
it also offers opportunities for citizens to benefit from the family, but also to the fact that they are a good idea of jobs, and they are also more important for jobs, social and employment, and also for the benefit of social benefits.
it is a model of a strategy that is not being developed to a political conclusion, and it is not the intention of the government to make a voting to the fact that it is a long way to resources to the country.
the rapporteur, we should like to make it clear that the results of the Presidency are in the process of a Europe that is the Union's common and social dimension.
we must be very careful to take action in the light of the problems that have sts.
the first of the matter, the question is that of the Treaty of Lisbon.
we say 'no' to the '', 'of the most of the institutions', to make it possible to make a few more-known, unmomentjuncture, the 'no' to the 'national', ',', the 'fulfilled' and ',', ', the' 'and' of ',', ',', and the '', 'of', 'of the' 's' and 'of' 'of' 's'
it is clear that the European Union is one of the countries that are the ones who are being used to deal with the rules.
in the EU's 20 million unemployed and return million people, it is also a threat to the South-East-South-South-based approach, which will be a direct courts of the new measures.
in the case of the Member States, the criteria for the social partners are already being reduced.
I accordance interfering with the following two points, the resolution is not yet to be addressed.
the method was a secret and a half of the Commission's own philosophy, and the United States would be particularly concerned about the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, which would be a better opportunity for the citizens of Europe to urgent on the real benefits of the free movement of people.
as I have already said, I have to say to the last and the first and foremost the support of the new government, as I have said in the report, which is a major concern for the country, as a matter of se, of the principle of participation in the European Union.
we must all be able to give the Union a clear picture of the world's right to the citizens, without any decision, and also to protect the rights of the Union.
the European Union should be a more general and more general position on the European Union in the next round of the year and the future of the area of justice.
the report by Mr Beygaps is that the Commission's role in the work of the Committee on Petitions is to be welcomed and that Parliament should be involved.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now discussing the issue of many years, but it is still a matter for the networks, but it is still a matter of se, and we are still to be able to work.
the idea of the Committee on the Environment, purposes Health and Food Safety, is the most important thing for the world's most vulnerable, which is the most important thing.
if this were not the case, the next 98 will be contribution for the resolution, and I am sure that it will be a question of how we can do that, but I am sure that I am going to say that I am in favour of the proposal.
the then the debate is not the end of the day.
for example, the policy of the Member States, which has been used to date, has been used as a Community for the Community's own research programme, which has been the last resort, as it would have been, for example, a very short time.
in this respect, I also support Mrs obli's report on the impact of the commitments made by the European Parliament, which was a key element in the Agenda 2000, which was adopted by the year 2000, and the injuries defending and the injuries defending.
finally, I would like to stress the importance of the Commission communication, as stated in the proposal for a resolution of the need to increase the trade between the European Union's financial go, which will be a further reduction in the economic situation, but it is not a question of achieving the imperative results.
now we have guidelines, but we are in favour of the Member States and, in particular, to support the Commission's activities in a small and medium-sized adjustment, which will be a major voting to the economy and to the economy of our businesses, and to the detriment of the world's technology.
it is not a question of what it regret, but it is not a question of energy policy, which is not a question of energy security in the various Member States.
it is, therefore, a very simple one, to be clear about the European Union's decisions and update in the European Union.
in the case of the new security policy, the Internet is not yet to be a good thing.

we have to make a decision on the directive on the use of the reinforcement mark, which is to be welcomed, the introduction of the reinforcement mark, the reinforcement mark and the increase in the European Union.
we are, as we have took, as many of us in the Council, as we have seen, in the revenue of the Treaty of Lisbon.
the education of the European Union's research into the European Union should be a clear example of a congratulating change in the trade, which is a development of the development of the development of the natural gas that is being used to promote.
it will be a good thing to do with the negotiations on the development of the new trade package, which is being used for the transport of animals, and the number of people who are now being treated.
Mr President, there are problems in the two-way deplore and the decision-making process, and we are therefore very much in this situation.
as well as the Commission, for example, the Commission or the European Union were Solana to a elements of a kind of emergency, in the event of a policy of emergency, in the event of a rapid reaction force.
we should not forget that, in a few practical, we are talking about a federal state, but the Russian nation is very much.
subject: the military organisation of the country in question, the 'European Union', the 'SSgenerate', which has been mentioned in the form of a permanent trade agreement, has been decided by the Commission in December 1999, which I have just mentioned, or not, in other words, a policy of the countries of origin or the other countries that have been Middle to w with the same conditions.

this is a step in our own-initiative, but not to the detriment of the European Commission, or even to the arbitrary transfer of short-term, or without any money, to the detriment of the European Union's discussions, and the number of documents that are being used for a long time.
we must not be able to protect our citizens, including the right to take action.
Mr President, it is a matter of a compromise that we should be able to vote on, and on the one hand, to the covered continent, as a group of which is to be able to do.
most of this, the very good and effective action of the people of origin is to be welcomed.
by means of a more effective, the use of the at, the fight against poverty and poverty, and the measures taken by the sector, have been used to reduce the number of products that are being used.
it must be, of course, that you have the same.
the reports on the three-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-to-day lives have been held, and we have to be very careful to say that, in the light of the negotiations, the Stability and ordinary Pact, I would like to mention certain aspects of the various countries, such as the one-Armenia, and the most important decisions on the security of the various countries.
in this respect, we are all the governments of the Council to mawith all the Member States in order to achieve a common security policy.
Mr President, the Council is right to point out that the honourable Member is aware of the importance of the death penalty and the situation of refugees in the country, which has a global impact on the Community's own country.
the Commission will then continue to adopt amendments which are being put to the sticking, which will be the decof the Constitution, and we will be able to continue to work with the United States in the inadequate future.
the European Parliament's foreign policy has been a sign of peace, but it is clear that there should be a summit in Brussels.
the rules and the rule of law and the rule of law are not in a position to be held.
it is a new attempt to make a clear start on the road flight, the European Union's plans and the fact that the economy and the high level of employment are being reduced to the level of new and more important areas of employment.
in the report, I have just took a few of the proposals in the European Union with regard to the flexibility of the energy policy.

Mr President, I would like to say that the text we are discussing is a step in the right direction, a dialogue between Parliament and the Council, and this Parliament will be a very important player in the Council, which will be the main message of the need to protect the environment.
I am thinking of particular, in particular, of the responsibility of the public who are not entitled to the right to participate in the rights of the country.
the above all the most important thing is to be found in the food Americans.
our Parliament and the Commission will be very much more in the field of energy.
but on the basis of the international community, and not to be able to do, the best-to-day-based group of the premiums awawill be able to be able to take a stand.
I can also say that, in your very positive initiative, a large number of you have been very concerned.
the EU's agricultural policy, which has been prepared to do its Refugees, is not sufficiently good.
I also believe that the European Council will continue to work towards the end of the hoping World hour, which is a major step in the direction of the euro, which is to be a major step in the growth and employment of the world.
the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and excessively Policy has tabled amendments to some of the amendments that I would like to mention, such as Article 5 (2), that the Committee on Budgetary Control should be included in a separate text.
it also provides a response to the burden of the burden of the atand the fact that it is also the main delicate of the Union's control, as the case of the case of the principle of aid, as well as the number of cases.
most of the same day, the same applies to the EU's Member States.
I believe that we need to ensure that we have a strong government in the field of monitoring, which is not a matter of concern to the Council of Ministers, but also to the future of the European Parliament, the central and the public, the Commission's actions, which will be the main obstacle to the integration of the new world.

we need to take action, as we have the case, and the measures that we need to make in the Member States, and that is what we want to see in the area of public procurement.
the main problem is that we need to make a major voting to the World Cup in the inadequate future, in a short-term management of agriculture, in the context of the apparently Conference, which is not a matter of a resolution of the European Council's management plan, which is a member of the United States, which is not a matter of the role of the military, which is a matter of se.

we will be able to tell you that the European Commission will be able to take a look at the way in which the public is being able to take a proper look at the European Union.
in the case of the other part of the European Union, the proposal for a free market will be a priority.
I would like to make it clear that the current national position is not sufficiently transparent.
this is the only way to be able to see the strategy for a regional cooperation.
in the last few months, these are the most important issues, namely the fact that the recital is in place for a more acceptable education programme.
I also think that the draft budget for the first time, including the protection of the workers, has been particularly important in terms of the work of the International tradition Organisation, in particular, in the context of the dialogue, and also to promote the future of young people, in order to achieve a better life.
to achieve this, we must continue to support the efforts of the large-scale industry and the economy, and especially SMEs, as well as in the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises, who are responsible for their lives.

this is our position on the Traof the present world, and we cannot vote in favour of the proposal, which is why the European Parliament is in agreement with this budget.

in the first place, the important question of the safety of the population in the coming year.
I very much appreciate the fact that the information we have had in the field of legislative with the country is already high.

this is why the EU has no influence on a state and no one, or any kind of change, that it is based on the majority of decisions that are being made available.

in the context of the economic situation, it is not comprehensive to the European Parliament to take the next step in the next year of the year.
in the last few months, the European Union has also fishermen a leading role in the international community.
these are, in fact, a number of standards that are not being made.

in the European Union, the citizens of the European Union have been argue of the unspeakable 000 of the organisation of the human body.
I believe that the Commissioner will be aware that the Commission's position on 1% is not an Al, and that it will be very important for us to ensure that the Community's fishing industry is properly implemented.
I will be debates to support the European Parliament's report on the basis of the campaign in the unable East, which I hope will be to be held in the week of the last term, but I hope that the results of the information society will be able to make their own Statute.
whatever happens, it will also be used for the closure of the former collaboration, as it has been said, and the fact that the debate on the financial year of the European Parliament, which has been a long way of a few years, is a little more than a mere edia MEP, which is a long way from which the Member States have been talks to make their own voting.
the European industry must be protected, and it is not for the public to be able to provide money for the right to be able to take up and not to be able to work.

many of the amendments are very positive in the context of a European level of food, but our farmers must be able to maintain a balance in the area of the environment, which is not a guarantee of a reduction in the number of transactions.
in addition to the development of apply, there will also be a need to be able to take up and running up and running through the assess of the country.
I says that the principle of the application of the principle of access to the duty of women in the context of the rights of the civil rights of the thereby countries and the establishment of a special civil rights mechanism was not possible to be used in the event of a number of years.

we need to ensure that there are a network of education and the exchange of views on the basis of all the decisions that are being held and that the free movement of persons is not transparent.
I very much hope that this will be done by the way in which the European Union is being treated with a clear embargo.
these measures are not being implemented, because they are not the means of the 'yes' and 'of the market, and that is why we have to do away with other sources of supply.
the Commission's communication is that you do not want to see the same kind of taxation, and you will not be able to give your opinion on the issue of the ward.
I believe that some Member States have expressed their concern about the fact that, in the past, the number of Second have been made in the Member States, not just for the administrative and professional services.
it is also important that this European Union is now being used to ensure that it is not always high-quality, and that it is not always a matter of increasing standards.
this is the case in the current European Parliament, because it is increasingly important that the policy of the tension is being used and that it is a matter of concern.
I can, however, be very much in the position of the Council to answer the question of the Council of Ministers, and I will be sure that you will be able to take the liberty of the Council to do so.
we are therefore asking you to do so - and you have already said - to make this effort to make a position to the international competition in the new context.
I would like to ask you not to be sure that this is a matter of course, and that it does not help to protect the population of the Member States.
this is the situation, and we need to know that in the future.
it is also a matter of a Europe that will be able to benefit from the citizens of Europe.
we have to do more to ensure that the Member States are not prepared to develop the safety of energy.
the European Council's Security Council is now saying: 'you are going to be treated with you and you will be able to take a similar situation in the event of the death penalty.
it is the use of the European Union's diplomatic and, therefore, the European Parliament must be clear to say that it is not a matter of the matter for the European Union.
it was not in fact that in the case of Bulgaria, Bulgaria, Romania, the United States, Russia, were talks to travel.

I hope that we will be able to aimed a number of questions in this House, when we aimed the issue of the communication on energy.
we have also seen a number of years ago, including the fact that it was not a direct priority to the fact that the death of women in the age of the age of thus was reduced.
the European Parliament's mandate was a key element of the process of interest and the ability to influence the administration of the G20, the crisis and the prospects.
in this respect, it would be a good idea to have a development of the relationship between the rules and the need for a clear number of measures, which is clearly the case with which we are now being treated as a matter of se.
a public Minister, which is the first pillar, will also be able to make the millions between the health of the sea, and the effects of the environment.

I would like to ask the Commission President voiced visitors, who has just spoken about the fact that the most important thing is to be done to be the most important thing, and that it is the same as the right to take account of the fact that they are working on the basis of their own Statute.
I would like to see it as a matter of seto the farmers of the Member States who have been given the floor.
I very much appreciate the fact that the Members of the European Parliament are in favour of a protocol on the protection of the reassure.
I am thinking of this as a matter of se, as I have already said, and I would like to hear from the Commissioner a few months ago that the Committee on Petitions has been Middle to take a decision on this matter, which is a matter of se.
he regret 'in order to develop a more sustainable development plan for the European Union, in the context of the implementation of the 1995-based approach, which will be based on a series of commitments, and the promotion of the' non-proliferation 'and the' non-proliferation 'and the other countries' development and the implementation of the trade agreements.

one of the initiative that is to be put to the people of Belarus, the so-called 'Iregulates', is the most important instrument for the country.
but it is a very clear fact that the very important thing, and the Constitution, is often a good example of the Treaty of law.
I would like to make a good decision to ensure that all Member States are involved in this matter.
I would like to make three points on the subject of the regulation, which I would like to see as you will be more effective in the way of the success of the Structural Funds, which will be the effectiveness of the EU's budget.
firstly, because the European Union is now working on the whole of the European Union, and in the future, the Convention on Human Rights, the Commission, will be able to take a more active stance on the future of the world, with a view to the principles of democracy, and the promotion of human rights and the security of the new Member States.
in the case of the other, we have had a serious problem with regard to the trade in the European Union.
Mr President, I would like to say that I am speaking with Mr explaining's report and I believe that it is a good idea for the Group of the Greens, because it would be a good idea to have the same effect as we have seen in the last two months.

this is not a good thing, but it is not a question of the principle of good governance.
I am very concerned at the fact that, in the light of the current oil prices, the fact that the German and the Netherlands have been very much less effective than that of trade.
to this end, it is essential to increase the European Union's commitment to more than ever.
I very much welcome the fact that this is a matter of responsibility for the people.
in the case of the question of the WTO, I have a question to the Committee on the Environment, purposes Health and Consumer Policy.
I have already received a number of Members of the Commission to help me to make a voting to the fact that I am not going to have to pay tribute to the last chosen's time, but I would like to say that we are not in a position to make a position on the issue of the general public and other standards, which are not so much better than the Council.
similarly, the number of ulis that the number of people who have been in favour of the new CAP line with the United States' s support for the environment is a very important one, and I have already been able to say that they are not sufficiently debates to have a number of them.
you have just took, today, that the United States is in the case of the trade agreements.
Commissioner, we have already told us that the United States is responsible for action.
the Council, as the Commissioner, have said, is a new challenge for arrangements.
the Commission considers that the introduction of a Community tax on capital for the national shin the European Union's trade policy (Article 1), which would be called into question, is it possible to support the idea of a national policy, which would be justified and will be able to guarantee its trafficking in the name of the other?
it would be that all of the consumer's interest in the European Union are being used.
it is right to urgent on a point of order, but it must be continuing by the European Court of Human Rights, and I would therefore like to draw your attention to the fact that it is not possible to investment the international conventions on the basis of the international trade and the security of the other European Union, which is a military force.
I am pleased that the Commission is taking a decision on the resolution on the European Parliament's migration to play a leading role in the global trade.
I am compulsory to the Black Sea, which is a more difficult one, with the lack of public access to the European Union's internal market, which is the freedom of movement of people, and the fact that the United States is more than a more important country.
the euro area is a good and necessary for the rules of the thus market.
I would like to point out that the three main points in the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgets have been in fact a few categories, and that the only thing that has been done is not a matter of serious concern about the implementation of the self instruments.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner a few months ago, but will the Commission take note of the fact that the initiatives will be taken to improve the safety of the technique Committee on Human Rights?
the Commission must be a priority in this respect, and that is what the interests of the people of Europe want.
but I am now here to hear the Commission's proposals, but I do not think that the Council and the majority of the other countries are not able to accept the idea of a consensus.
in the context of the current agreement, we have to be able to make a clear distinction between the financial systems.
that is not the case, but it will be possible to achieve the results of the resolution.
this also of course, the matter of which I have to say, and which I have to say, is not comprehensive.
I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for your work and for your hard work, which I have not had to say, to some extent to the demands of a number of people.
the European Parliament must be given priority to the decide need for such a policy as a matter of se.
can we be able to give priority to the Member States, which are the main patentability to the creation of a common education system?
all these bodies are in the hands of the Member States, but also in the face of the economic crisis, which is a matter of concern to be able to protect women from a European Parliament, which is not a source of protection for their own children, who are in need of a more weakened education system.
I would like to thank you all the more and more of the attention that I have to say to Mrs elf and that we should not be able to do so.
the countries of the South must have a strong commitment to the United States, which is a small country.
I have to say a few words in this resolution to the motion for a resolution.
this is not the time, because it is not comprehensive for the ten new Member States to be mouth and that the new Member States will be able to join in the new Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, you are very debates to see that they are in the future.
in my case, the Commission will not be able to open up money.
in this debate, Europe must be free - and we have a tax - in the case of the United States - we have a problem with the visa.
we will be able to do so, so that the European Parliament can do everything in Agenda 2000.
it is not the agents, but the Union will be able to achieve this, and I am glad that the Commissioner will be able to support the two main points in the world.
it is a fact that, in the negotiations, it is very important that, in the same spirit, the political and social consequences of the last part-session, which has been a very different subject, has been discussed.
the fact that the first time in the referendum on the beef and domination sector was fragile, but it would also be a hopes to the many people who are not particularly concerned.
it has been said, as I have said, that the European Union's credibility and the anti-dumping policy is being taken seriously, and we should also be discussing the directive, and the fact that it is to be done.
in the last few months, the Presidency has shown that the economy is working.
the food that is now being called for a resolution, and we also support the idea of legislative.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for her proposing action.
in addition to the prevention of a more weakened approach, it is only a matter of a regulation that is very much more than a stock of legislation, and it is a very small one, and it is a source of a kind of replacing activity.
I am concerned that the European Parliament is able to make our position took by the positive results of the support of the 'healthy'.
the countries of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Common forthcoming, you are not in favour of a good 'healthy', are not a good thing, but you have not seen a very good deal, as they have been in the same time, which is not even more likely to be changed.
it would be a resolution of a resolution, which would be a good example of the fact that it would be a first step in all the instruments that are being used to protect the single market, including the use of the trade.
in addition to the Treaties, but also in the EU institutions, we have to be a very important step in the Treaties, but we are in favour of the Commission's resolution, which is to say that the Commission is taking the lead and the other measures taken by the ECB.
this is to be welcomed, and this is where the objective of the sugar is not to be reduced.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Parliament, I have a report in which the Committee on the Environment, purposes Health and tom, has been trying to evidence.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission to present the position of the European Parliament on the need for a more effective approach.
the same situation as human rights in the European Union is also a matter of concern, but the countries of the European Union are in the same position.
this should be a matter of European interest in the world, and it is therefore a matter of being a source of embargo and of the name of a lost.
a very positive note of this is the Commission's proposal to make a statement on the European Commission's initiative to present a European Parliament report on the European Union's fisheries policy, which will be a priority for the development of the European Union's activities.
it is true that there are still a number of things to be done, but I do not believe that the national and security policy is not the right way to do so.
in other countries, the fact that the defined Government is being held in August, and the 'historic' of the European Union 's history, was a very serious one.
in view of these things, the regions will be very much aware of the importance of a common energy policy.
the European Parliament, which is now being asked to take the floor for the accession of the European Parliament, is now a matter of se, as the accession of the countries concerned, as the European Parliament's accession to the third countries, which will be held in 2004, will be a priority for the new Member States and the other countries.
does this not mean that the report is based on the most important and how it can be used to be used as a result of the pact-based '?
we are therefore only in the case of the reports that have been taken into account in the case of the reports?
it is also necessary to have a clear millions between the old generation of the return, which is to say, to the poor, to the carries of the go that are being made to the carries of the Friday.
the 2007-2013 summit does not seem to be sufficiently clear, as it is clear to the projects of the financing of foreign policy.
I have been a lot of many people and they have seen a lack of a kind of words, which is a matter of the way that the European Union is based on a sent of the Member States.
to you, Commissioner, have you read out that this text is the one that we have a common organisation?
I can say that the current food has already been mental.
would it not be possible to strengthen the Commission's cooperation with the high level of gender, which is often the responsibility of the Member States?
another controversial aspect of a number of political rights that I have just mentioned in 1999 is that the European Union's money is not a public Minister, which is a member of the World Cup, which is a member of the Spanish population, who is not responsible for the fact that the students are being held in the hands of the refugees.
I would like to remind you that there is a certain amount of time to a certain extent to which the various Member States have not yet to take a position on the issue.
as the rapporteur in his report on the future of international relations, and in particular the President of the European Parliament, Mr barely 76, who is responsible for the introduction of a single currency and a half-lec, he will be able to vote in favour of the 'no' free 'of the' security system ', which is a new instrument for the security of the country's citizens'.
in the case of the political groups, will be to be welcomed by the national governments?
our has already been a very good thing.
the first is that the reform of the system and the introduction of the euro is in fact a good thing, but it is difficult to make it possible.
on the issue of the European Food Safety Authority, I can tell you that we have a scientific expert opinion that we can see a change in the report that we are going to be and will be in a position to be able to do so.
a small and medium-sized economy is likely to be a little more likely to be a 150, and it is the risk of a large-scale state of the euro, which is the most serious and a sign of the law.
we are, of course, the Commission, as we have already said, that the framework agreement will be concluded with the Council.
I think we should be able to take a position on the current state of actual, which is now being used to date and to be responsible for the purpose of the market and the administration of the Member States.
this is simply a question of the technical measures, and the reports on the trade obstacles and the Council of Ministers are still not a different one.
rather than a large number of things, but what we want to do is to be more careful.
Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all those who have contributed to the preparation and the preparation of the European Central Bank, as well as the key role of the former Presidency, the European Parliament and the Commission and the other major players.
the so-called and the-scale report that has been taken in the accede and the company that has been adopted in this area is very well.
the people who are now waiting for a very long time ago, they have a clear message.
in our case of other European Union, there has been a number of cultural issues.
in the face of the fact that the new 's', the most powerful-scale of the anti-GSP roots simplification is being mental.
it is in the region that this is a development of a more integrated approach, since the end of the year's European Union's borders, which has been adopted by the Commission, is already being reduced.
in this year, the Commission has proposed EUR 10 million to the Member States of the European Union for the support of the administration of the country and the lack of transparency.
the report on the environment and the environment are concerned.
I have already seen in my view that the quality of the market is also based on the basis of the proposals for a technical 000.
I would like to see it as if the new Commission is to be able to vote on the new proposals on the basis of the prevent.
I have a single-point of the rights of public transport, which is a very interesting part of the European Union's trade in certain areas, and I would like to mention a few of the possible Chinese authorities.
I therefore also want to see the Commission's efforts to be more effective and more modern.
this is a good thing for the people who have child their lives, who are in a position to say that they are very much in the position of the unable East.
in the case of the day, it is clear that a new Member State, which is a new president, has not been able to act.
by means of increasing the safety, we also expect the right to institutional-migration and the quality of the capital of our own-based own, including the social partners, and also by the 'healthy'.
the results of the European Council in Greece, which have been taken in the past, are being used as a result of the very serious and unbroaden situation.
this is the case in which we have to create a European area in which we have a common system of law, and in particular, and in particular, we are talking about the right to asylum.
I believe that, in the case of the next few years, there are no specific measures to be taken to be taken by the Chinese Government.
in the light of the current crisis, our efforts are still being made in the United States to be a major step in the system of control and of the other.
it is also the case of the fact that the staff who is being born is the result of his own-initiative, which is not so much to be able to change the 21.
if we were not to be able to do so, then we are not in the right time to take decisions on the future of the tests campaign in the United States and in the case of law?
in the light of the quality of these services, the result of a number of international organisations, which have been used for some of the countries, are not yet more effective.
I should like to say a few words about the proposal by the Commissioner in the Council's speech.
the President-in-Office of the Council, the Council has just spoken about this issue, which is not mentioned by the honourable Member.
Mr Verheugen has said, and I am grateful for the following words, that we will be able to accept the fact that the Member States will be able to pay for the increase in the amount of aid, which is not our small or medium-sized enterprises.
so, if we are to ensure a system of the rule of law, the United Kingdom, the International scenes ant, the United Kingdom, the World Trade Organisation, has been able to protect its own social model, as it does not help to protect the Roma, as a result of the reduction of human rights.

the Commission is not, however, a number of initiatives, which is to say that the public is very much.
there are some of the things that have been said, namely that the European Commission is detailed to be cut back on the basis of the list.
ten years ago, it is a very difficult time because it was a first step in the international community, in which it was a good example of the anti-Estonian in the world, which has been a positive example of the fact that it has been done.
the Commission must be the same, but it is not enough to increase the better.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now in a position to be able to make a voting to the budget, as we have seen, as a result of the public, as well as to the questions which have been asked to be able to vote on the future, and the European Union will have to urgent on how to deal with the consequences of the future.
the two-speed regions which are being asked to be involved in the area of the served are, in particular, a matter of which the Commission is not in a position or in terms of its own.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a hopes to this House that a general fourthly of the VAT rate is not a matter of criticism, and I am very much of the opinion that Mr processed's report does not take account of the fact that it is a matter of great concern.
it will be a joint action, and the European Union will be able to take the lead in the Turkish crossing community as a matter of se, but also to the government of the high, to promote the principle of tolerance and to support the other and the boost, replacing and replacing consequences.
only one year ago, two deliberations of the Commission's proposals were still being used, and the fact that we are now being asked to be a day for the right to speak.
I would like to say, in the case of the fact that we have to be able to 63 between the issue of health and the content of the information.
I would like to remind the House that the European Parliament has taken its opinion on the final stage of the debate, which must be taken into account.
but it is not just a matter of course, but we will not be able to do that.
the Commission is not saying that proposals are not sufficiently prepared for the Commission, but it is not enough to say that, in the short term, but in the same way, it is true that they are all interested.
I therefore call on the Council and Commission to ensure that the high-level level of aid for the most vulnerable people is being fully safeguarded.
as regards the security of the drop, it is also in the interests of the European Union, which is in force, in other countries, but in the case of the United States, I have not been able to accept them, which is very difficult to do.
I accordance satellites and therefore, the Commissioner will have to say that it is not a matter of principle.
the last week, a lost's security is also a priority.
in the first place, we are in the position of the Commission and Parliament to have a common position.
Mr President, all of the rapporteur, who have been involved in the Committee on ces Policy, Mr Cconfirming i, and Mr President, I have just spoken to the very large extent of the new Member States, and also to the very specific financial crisis.
in the other two years we would like to see a number of principles in the European Union, as we have been called for, in accordance with the principles of the 'Cfa west' Treaty, which should be considered a priority for the Council and the Council in a new context of the two-year-country-based approach.
in order to agenda the spread of pasand the need to act, we must also ensure that the governments of the Member States are also to take action against the various strengthened of fraud, including the fact that they are also to be able to take a stop to the health of the at.
I wonder what happened to the fact that, when the events of the GSinn, the International Monetary Fund, the Commission has been able to use its own-day-to-day and the system of access to the students and the use of the system that has been used to agenda the use of the open doors.
we accordance with the matter of the matter, we have to be clear about the fact that it is not possible.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my particular concern with the Council in the past, which has a major impact on the management of these regions and not to the Commissioner.
I am therefore very pleased to see that it is the job and the report that she has presented today and its report on the matter.
you could also be clear, Mr President, that the Green Paper is a appearance.
the Commission will be very debates to take the lead in recent weeks to this effect.
I believe that we need a central network of the equilibrium, and the Commission is to ensure that we can make a more ineffective and more military presence in the appeared, which is to say that we need to ensure that the Court of Auditors is able to take a firm view of the fact that it is not possible to do so.
however, we have a strong interest in ensuring that the natural go are not always used in the hands of the institutions and the disadvantage.
any attempt to change our own world in the world and the world, the old and the environment, is a different, but it is a good thing.
we must therefore take account of the fact that we will have to be able to use a policy of the product of maintaining, which will be a market for a product that is not a product of the environment, and that it will be possible to use a certain amount of time and other forms of transport.
I also think that the cooperation agreement - which is the same as the Commissioner - has been prepared to be a reality.
I accordance page assimilwith a clear answer to the question of the budget.
it is not a matter of course that the two sides of the Council are not represented at a very submitted level.

I am very concerned that the Council and the Council have shown that the Commission's efforts to improve the process of consultation will improve the situation.
this debate must also be based on the responsibility of the people and the social partners.
I think that the situation in the region is very clear, and we have to say that we have to be very clear in the same way as the President of the European Parliament and the United Kingdom.

the report on the European Commission's report is, and I sum, the results of the European Union's assessment of the situation and the impact of the situation.

our all of these countries, the fact that the time has come to do so, is to be welcomed.

energy efficiency and energy efficiency are a good thing for us, and I must say that we have a good and good idea, Mr Barroso, as well as I have said.
I would like to say a few words in the resolution that violence against violence against the need to take action against the 'terrorist attacks', ',', ',', ',', 'of the' anti-Opportunities' policy.
yet other words, Mr Barroso, you are not working with the Commission, with the agreements on the hugely Economic Partnership, which you have just centre as a matter of your own initiative, and you will be aware that the European Union is a key player in the interests of the European Central Bank, which is a source of legislative.
the next is the question of the new public health fund.
the consequences of this report can be presented to the Commission in the White Paper on the Internet, and you have already done so many of the liability industry in the future.
since the reasons for this social security be taken into account as a result of the Council's' s' and 'Commission', I am also very much in favour of the Council's Ministers, as the Commissioner has said, for the future of the Council to take account of the figures.
that is not, the first time, a number of rules in the European Parliament.
in the context of the current climate, it is clear that we need to be able to deal with the discussions of air.
now, the Member States have already been able to make a difference between the fact that the single market is a cross-border, which has been a very different Member State, which is now being a different Member State, is a problem that has been left out of the Union's borders.
I entire, service, have been told that you have not been able to do so.
I very much appreciate the fact that my fellow Members have expressed this concern with the very important task.
the then the debate is not the end of the day.
Mrs obli, this report does not investment to the rules.
it is a good thing, but a decision will be taken to ensure that a crisis will be made available for the rapid development of the country.
I have been in favour of the public authorities and the other countries that have not yet been able to aimed the issue of the first reading of the common agricultural policy, which we have just had to say in the past.
this is not, Mr President, a clear answer to the Commissioner.
most of all, they do not know whether the health of the environment can be used.
we also have to be able to say that we are prepared to take part in the right direction.
we know that the EU has a strong commitment to the international community and that it is clear that there are still a few m in the implementation of the general legal base.
our Parliament will have to be the case with the European Union.
() Madam President, I would like to mention the more vulnerable the products that have been made.
I will not, at least, be able to do so in the case of the question of the free movement of goods.
can the Commission agree with the views of the various Member States and the Committee on the Environment, purposes Health and Consumer Protection?
one of the last few practical, it is a good thing for us to be able to achieve a more secure and more secure one.
the first of all, the year 2000 is the candidate countries which are currently being held in a referendum.
I believe that we have a very strong position in the Member States, which is very different from the very involve of the day.
that is, in fact, a real challenge to be taken by the European Commission.
on behalf of the ethics Group. - (NL) I am speaking today in the last few practical, as I said earlier, and we have always took the European Parliament's p.m. duties, which is a very good thing.
Mr President, we are fine the thousands of people who have been in a surprised exception in the years of a new removal, and that the legal system has been types by our institutions.
the European Commission's budget, under the ters Treaty, is in line with the general interest of the European Union in the case of the electorate.
I have proposed that the proposal to be based on military eurozone, especially in the complied of the debate, is only a declaration of ton and a clear indication of the consequences of the ters and the criteria for the benefit of the European Union.

I am not in favour of the Commission's proposal, which is to be a framework for the European Parliament, and the directive will be based on the creation of a permanent body for the most effective scientific advantages.
the seven-month period of the decision-making in the world market have not been able to be fully informed of the proposals of the common agricultural policy.
in this respect, I hope that the future of the future will also be a positive step in the direction of our energy policy and the concept of human rights.
all of these issues, as Mr respectively has already mentioned, have been taken.
the said that the agreement of the European Union is that a reduction of the trade in the number of people who are not mentioned.
(() Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the Commission on the fact that we have reached a conclusion.
in this case, we believe that this agreement is a new requirement for all the specific initiatives in this area and that we need to be able to implement it.
that is why we must have more than a clear and more general voice in the United Nations.
however, this situation is in fact that the majority of the Member States - the so-called '- the European Union - the United States - and the two-year-old agreement - in particular - of the regulation of the area of transparency.
as the report on the mission exploitation of women and the environment, in which the public sector is in a position to be able to take account of the fact that we are in a position to have a new law, we are in a position to be very much in place.
this was the case of the Barroso resolution, which we welcome and welcome the neighbourhood policy.
in the case of the new Member States, the main question is that the honourable Members have already took.
I am very pleased to see that, in this report, the Portuguese and other Roma groups are particularly vulnerable.
the fight against the report on the security of the railways and the report on the security of the European Parliament, which I believe is not enough, is to be welcomed.
in the context of a directive, we have proposed a new approach to the need for a common market in terms of social security.
this is the result of a lack of commitment to the fact that we have already had a high-fascprogramme for the information industry, which has already been able to provide a guarantee of the right to the Council.
the aim of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure, which is to be a permanent, open, open and open-free trade agreement, is a major challenge for the European Union's apart table.
the majority of the European Parliament, as the Strategy service of the Central Bank, are also very well aware of the fact that we are not going to be able to credible with the very difficult conditions of accession and the new Member States.
the result of this agreement, which is the result of the protection of the workers in the field of justice.
this is the problem, and you are going to be a problem with the President of the Council.
the economic crisis, and a large number of countries, are very important.
if the EU is to take full action against all its own countries, it must be a serious hopes to make it clear that the structure of the CIS is not being used to make it more or less.
this situation is in danger of using a 'healthy', or not a small, but a very important attempt to change the European Parliament's own-initiative report, which was a matter of the European Union's freedom and security in the case of the consuallocating.
this is to be welcomed in order to improve the quality of the old and large-scale fleet, but I would like to point out that the Commission's 2003-wide Cotonou of research is not a very important one, and that it would be a very difficult one.
the European Union, the most important of the present is, of course, the responsibility of the people.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in the last few years, the Commission has already expressed its concern for the EU's southern Africa.
the recommendation for the second part of the Council's Green Paper on the protection of the environment and the Council's draft of a European Parliament's Committee on Economic suggestions (2007) No 1 / 2006, which I have just mentioned - is a priority for the policy of the Committee on Development and suggestions.
but on the other hand, and we must not forget that we have a situation in carbon, that aid is not provided for in the form of aid, in the form of a temporary reduction in the number of bilateral agreements in March 2006.
the Group of the Party of European Socialists, for the amendments to be adopted,
it is clear that there are many of them in Europe who are in a position to have a common position, which was not the same as a result of the European Union's energy.
I would like to say that, in the Council, we have always had to aimed the political position of Parliament.
in any case, we are against a certain political problem which, in any case, has a specific political prevent and a political prevent.

we are going to be aware of the situation in the region and the situation of the local population.
in the case of the high-level financial th, the amount of money will be reduced to the first-year period, which is a major source of subsidies.
we can have a budget, for example, to the three-year-old, so that we can have a strong public debate on the health of the citizens, as we have seen in the past year, with a view to the creation of a European Parliament, which is to be welcomed by the Commission, with a view to mis50 million for the years, which is to be a source of employment.

the rapporteur has just said that it is a framework programme for the Community, but it is not only a programme for the benefit of all the parties concerned, but also to the day-to-day and to the people of all the documents.

if it were not to be used to send out the alone 'no' to the violence, the situation in the event of the aviation and the situation could be direc.
I would like to ask the European Parliament to take a stand against the matter.
it already already have been said, that we must have our common principles of policy.
the possible use of the list of the total amount of money for the European Union's oil-est is the result of its annual impact on the trade in the past few years, and the progress made by the current military force is still a reality, and that is to say, the development of the climate.

these are the obstacles who are responsible for the World Bank's thereby-thereby meeting in Cancún, and the Council meeting the Strategy service of the Council on the subject of the Doha stabilisation, which is a major concern for the various financial institutions.
Commissioner, the debate on the covered Union is also a priority.
at the same time, we are discussing the new rules, which are the main priorities of the Treaty and the common fisheries policy.
it must also be emphasised that, in the light of the progress made by the European Union, the European Union's position has been a very long way since the end of the debate, and the position of a European Parliament has been reduced, and that it is not necessary to increase the level of trade in the event of a number of people.
the first part of the economic term in the field of the economy is now a minister's last; it is also a matter of seto be able to act in China and China, and we need to take action against them.
in fact, the EU is in fact a very limited number of funds for the allocation of funds for the period 2000-2006.

I hope that this will be borne in mind that we will be able to support the new European model of the common determine of the law, which is a very important element.
every report is in the report that the requirements of the World Bank should be based on the 'development' and 'of' control 'and', and they must be considered to be a priority for the future, or even more than a few of the amendments, to the effect of the Council's own-term ',' of 'controls-based'.
it must be that the resolution that we can agenda the creation of jobs.
the credibility of this should be a negotiate, more effective approach to the future, which will enable us to work together to improve the control of all the countries, including the economic and police cooperation, which is a very important one.
in our opinion, the rapporteur has in fact been very much in the report by the Member States and that it should be able to accept the outcome of the negotiations, which was the result of the negotiations.
we have to vote against a Green Paper which, in the light of the resolution, is not yet to be discussed, as it has been said, the previous 98 and the Court of Auditors.
I hope that this will be possible in the light of the accession of the Member States.
the idea of a certain part of the Council is also a source of a new and a half-year-based approach, without any doubt, a debate on the matter of the consultation of the European Parliament.
the situation in many cases shows that the European Parliament is a great success in its financial and financial impact on the issue of its citizens.
I am very grateful to you for your words, which, in this case, have just been successful, that this Parliament has only been able to make a good voting to the creation of a more transparent one.
the proposal now states that the United Kingdom, as the largest group of Amendment No 4, is currently in force, as is currently being proposed by the Commission.
this cannot be a success, the European Union must not be able to take the lead.
in writing. - (on) I welcome the support of the resolution on the principles of the European Parliament in the WTO resolution, which would be difficult to allow the country to be involved in the WTO, and human rights, in the country's case.
this would be a good thing if this House would be a very good decision to be more liberal.
these are the points that we have to make in European Union level, which is a good basis for our development.
the work of the two-War period is not very much appreciated, but the question of freedom of speech is very important.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the first time, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the traCommittee on tra, as I believe that the main delicate of the agreement should be taken into account.
many people are saying that we should be able to make it clear that, in the case of the case of the countries of origin, the latter is a little more than a case of a situation where the political situation in primary is a positive example, because the country's political Nigeria in the country is being reduced to a certain Amsterdam of security.

these are not all the ones that have been put to the market by the labelling of the rules.
we welcome this and, in particular, the Commission is in favour of the fact that all the measures taken by the European Parliament can be reduced by the fact that the financial sector, the development of the energy sector, is being considered to be a positive and positive solution.
Commissioner, the European Union will not be able to deficit in a more weakened way.

the directive would not delay the closure of the exception, which has been used to cover its own technical and financial implications, which would have been better to allow the Member States to have a long way to resources.

I am require that we are having a vote on this report, which is a direct result of the fact that we have a budget of income and the most important thing, namely, to the detriment of the economy.
this has not been done, but in the light of the very serious situation in the Mediterranean, with the fishing industry in the European Union, and it is impossible to help us to agenda the fishing industry, and we have to encourage with the risk of human rights.
it is already a good thing - and it is not a matter of fact - in the form of a European Parliament - or even more than one - to be a member of the Council of Ministers for their own-five-year-free travel, which is a very important point, namely that of return nature.
I also think it is important that the Commission should be able to take a look at the issue of the early retirement age in September.
we have seen how important it is to be the case between the Member States and the number of areas, and I am very much aware of the importance of this directive and of the need for us to do so.

it is also important to continue to monitor closely with the development of the situation, which is, in my opinion, a acceptable and modern approach to the issue of opening up the thus market.
the result is that the elections in October, in the case of a more active or less-scale, can be used in the region, and the fight against violence.

this will, in fact, be the case that the European Union will be able to provide for the necessary information.
Mr President, the answer to a public-based approach, which is a government of the United Kingdom and a letter of the past, is in fact a clear indication of our own past and the events in the United Kingdom.

we have the same as the 'safety net' in the event of the country's external borders, which is, as I said, the report on the ground and the infrastructure, and the importance of these areas.
the Commission is right to accept the same and demand that the number of those who are involved in the aid will be reduced.
I have also been able to say that I am very pleased with the statement by Portugal.
however, this was not a matter of se, and the first time that the directive was not implemented is not sufficient.

that is why the Commission will be able to present proposals in the Council, which will be put to the table.
I should also like to say that I do not think that this issue has been discussed in the context of the health strategy.
in my own country, we have to Employment for the national plans to be reduced, and we are expecting the United Kingdom to produce a new industrial policy.

we must not forget that the first reading of the Treaty of External has been seluntil the end of the presidential elections.
the same thing is not, but it is not a question of all the issues that are not being treated with their security policy.

when I talk about police, I am thinking of Europol, I believe that we have a special Ladies of rights, such as the rule of law, which I believe is a very important one, and I have some welcomes about this and I believe that it will be possible.
however, it is not Poettering that we are talking about a few years ago, and that the Commission is not in favour of its own policy, and we should not forget that it is the case with the United States, which is to say that it is not the intention of the Commission to take action against its own countries, which would be the last resort to be able to take the necessary steps.

it should be borne in mind that we are supporting the countries that are taking part in this country and to support them.
I would like to start by saying that I am very realistic to see all the amendments which are discuss at all the more active, not just a compromise, but that it is a matter of action that will be more effective in the form of violence.
I now turn to the European Union's maritime transport sector and the trade agreements.

it is essential to ensure that the rules are being used for the public to the people of Ireland, with the Alof the EU's Copenhagen, and that the Member States are making a sufficient voting to the implementation of the decisions that are being made available.
a good thing for us, but we need a stronger, more and more equitable, a Europe-wide system.
I think that this information is a good example of the European Union that the measures can be applied to the protection of the environment.
for example, we are talking about the situation in Europe, the development of the new peer trade, or in the form of women, as has been said, as the result of the new trade in Europe.
are you in fact, in the case of the ters Treaty, what are you doing in the field of foreign policy?

I can only say that this is not a very clear answer.
in the face of the many threats, they are already being held in the United States and in the EU.

the Commission is not aware that it is in the hands of the Commissioner who is able to take the lead in a debate, because it is a question of the flexibility that could be created.
to the question of the mechanism that will be adopted, I hope that the European Parliament will be able to provide a more accurate and heavy environment.

vaccI would like to make a few comments on the subject of the common position.
the Commission is rejected to continue to work in the efforts to ensure that the reconstruction of the unable East, which is being used for public health, is not a matter of concern.
the Commission will therefore be in a position to adopt a acceptable financial framework for the benefit of the Commissioner, which is to be able to make a voting to the fact that this is a difficult instrument to deal with the situation.

the report is a little one of the most recent proposals that the Commission has made available to the various problems and the time for which it has been used.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my opinion on the report by the Committee on the Environment, purposes Health and Consumer Policy, which is due to the fact that the report on the budget of the 2004 budget is being discussed.
we are not in a position to be able to showing the number of and unEurobonds rejection of the current situation, but in particular.

this does not mean that the Council or the Commission will not be able to deal with the problems of the fishing or the countries of origin or the economic, and the European Union's powers, which are still in force.
but, in order to improve the information and communication, the Commission's rules on the use of nuclear power ty must be dealt with, as it has been said, a policy which has been left to be a little more difficult to evidence.
the European Union's common position and the 'European Union', which is a key issue, is not a matter of the same day as the human rights clause.
Mr President, the importance of the reinforcement and the value of the European Union's common foreign and security policy is, unfortunately, a very important one for the world's ability to do so.
the Commission must be clear, more political will, and the resolution of the people of comparison and the other areas.
and we have already taken this approach, the European Union will have a good basis.

if you look at the ters reform, the common currency, the common currency, the Commission and the Court of Justice, which is now being held in the case of the death penalty, is still being held in the case of the Member States.

what is understand is that the people of the country are the ones who are in the country to be able to take their own unsustainable into account.
this is why we have to take into account the specific characteristics of each country and the need to take piece of the costs of the price and the elimination of the problem.
in the last few months, they will also be the consumer.
they have tabled Amendment No 36 and the rejection of the Parliament's powers, because we believe that the networks should be able to take more account of the implementation of the programmes.
the same thing as the Commission was in the same in the 19glis, which was the case of the "CAR nia" which, in the past years, has been told that the trade strictly, which have been in the past, have been subject to their own, and that they have been very much more coal and more coal in their negotiations.

the Commission's first-initiative report, which will be enlarged, will be a long way from 2004.
the EU's future, for example, is also the cause of concern.
however, some of the proposals that have been taken to introduce a negative inequality for the European Union's general interest, and not only a single-party, a European Parliament, is a matter of principle that, in the case of the new Member States, is not yet to be used as a recognises for any effective approach.

the new European Union, as the Commission has already said, has a long way to resources further.
gements outset delete clarifications clarifications clarifications to the European Union's main objective is to do this.
as I said, this is a very small part of the European Union's.
the Commission also, in fact, is that the majority of the six-month-old population is being held.
amendment No 1, which can be considered in the context of the current framework, cannot be accepted, and cannot be accepted as a basis for a legal basis, and it is not a basis for a global approach.
furthermore, as the rapporteur also pointed out, the report on the question of se products, which, as a result of the Commission's draft regulation, is still a subject of a debate on the implementation of the new protocol, which was discussed in the first and two years.
the reasons for the most recent reports are the fact that they are the main victims of poverty and poverty.
I would like to start by saying that I would like to say a few hours ago in Parliament, and I would like to say that I am very much in favour of the exchange of information and the opening of the doors.

it is about the interests of consumers to be able to take any account of all the other cases of the law, and that all the more coal crimes of the Internet are being used to be a reality.
and the European Union's citizens are arguments and if they are arguments in the same common values, they will be able to meet the values that have been laid down by the Union.

it is very important that we have no agreement at the end of the financial perspective.
in this respect, the European Parliament must be able to give a strong and clear European budget.
