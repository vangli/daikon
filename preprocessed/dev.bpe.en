we have the teaty , but we need its pope enhan@@ cement and even moe than that .
( applause )
that has not been addessed .
I can agee , howeve , with some of the speakes hee today on calling fo popotionate esponses and I can maintain that in the sense of the confidence that I have .
afte the vote on the epot which the Commission submitted to Paliament last yea , the Council and the Commission ageed to continue to suppot tobacco gowes .
I theefoe shae you concens .
M Pesident , the poposal fo a egulation ceating a apid eaction facility is one of those which ae founded on thooughly laudable intentions but which ae liable to fail as a esult of ed tape and tu@@ f was .
with 18 million people wo@@ kl@@ ess today in the Union , the new teaty had an obligation to make the pomotion of a high level of employment one of the objectives of the Union and to define an Euopean stategy in favou of employment , while allowing Membe States to define thei own national policies with egad to employment .
we cannot accept a situation whee Membe States do not conside all the Union &apos;s neighbouing egions im@@ patially , but instead , ty to favou thei own neighbous .
we explicitly put that fact to ou colleagues and decided in the Committee on Economic and Monetay Affais that we would confine ouselves to the methodology of the Commission &apos;s policy on SMEs and not comment on evey last detail of the policy itself .

futhemoe , this ageement should not allow companies fom thid counties to enjoy the benefits of an exemption fom EU customs duties to the detiment of local industies , wokes and incomes .
if it wee up to me and my goup , moe Membe States of the Euopean Union would be welcome to join the euo zone , povided that they met the citeia .
it is , in fact , esistance to an impotant Euopean movement that is in favou of ceating a eal intenal maket fo enegy and of having a vey stong policy against climate change .
well , that does not addess the issue of sp@@ il@@ la@@ ges , acci@@ den@@ tal damage o waste disposal , landfill and incineation .
we must seize this oppotunity in the inteests of the widespead use of non @-@ food cops .
the second , moe specific issue is the Commission assessment on the ules to be applied to eseach , study and expeiment contacts in the field of defence .
at the EU Foeign Ministes &apos; meeting in Bem@@ en on Fiday , the G@@ ym@@ n@@ ich meeting , I will stess that esouces cannot come fom the EU budget alone .
in my opinion , the name issue should not come fist .
M Pesident , M Banie was in contact yesteday with the Chai of the Committee on Budgetay Contol to explain to he the Commission &apos; s position on this subject .
the EU &apos;s l@@ ust fo endless enlagement is diven by a ca@@ ving fo eg@@ o @-@ building wold status , which goes hand in hand with the dive fo supe @-@ state@@ hood though the ejected Constitution .
the Commission communication on elations between the EU and the newly independent states of Cental Asia published in Octobe 1995 stated that the pimay objective of the Union was to maintain the stability of the egion which could best be done though the development of boadly @-@ based democatic institutions , the eduction of souces of conflict and economic efom .
with so many e@@ allocations , the most seious matte is the fact that the Euopean Paliament &apos; s own pioities , voted fo in Decembe , no longe exist .
having said this , I should just like to say a few wods about the motion fo a esolution that we shall be voting on next .
it does not m@@ ask the diffeences between the left and the ight and it is even vey disce@@ te about calling into question cetain wokes &apos; ights .
the etun of electonic waste fee of chage will be a good incentive .
this was also due to the fact that the specialist teams in the Czech Republic all caied on woking with total commitment , loy@@ al@@ ty and one hunded pecent pofession@@ alism .
pofessional associations will thus be closely involved in the implementation of the diective .
safeguading poduction , the ight to poduce , and food soveeignty and secuity equie an end to the sub@@ ju@@ gation of agicultue and food poduction to the maket and competitiveness .
but how and who is going to pay fo it ?
a final wod on the WTO question .
we could also adopt the same appoach with egad to the epot on bananas , othewise , we will be unable to get eveything done this moning .
the Swedish govenment has been foced to say that if moe steps ae taken in the same diection , a veto would have to be lo@@ dged .
secondly - and this is something that you have pointed out and something that is no doubt the most difficult thing to achieve - we also need , if we ae eally to change the situation , to alte cultual pactices when it comes to sexu@@ ality and , in paticula , to potect women and enable women to potect themselves .
finally , thee is flexibility , a eally cental subject .
I was inti@@ gu@@ ed just now to hea M H@@ ann@@ an fom the Consevative Paty suggesting this should be a matte of national discussion and democacy .
the pio condition is to ensue that the necessay secuity conditions ae in place fo intenational aid agencies to ensue effective delivey .
in this espect , it will be extemely impotant that we ae awae that &apos; business as usual &apos; is not an option .
as fa as Slovakia is concened , I would like to say to the honouable Membe that we ae not intefeing in intenal affais .
pojects which ae funded fom this paticula budget line meet enomous poblems when it comes to pocu@@ ing equipment .
in conclusion , I have to say that the outcome is a failue in tems of EU envionmental and health policy .
Madam Pesident , Commissione , I do not wish to blame you fo this evening &apos;s empty house , as this is entiely down to ouselves .
this is the pocess we ae commen@@ cing .
the pesent cisis in the Westen Sahaa and the entie conflict should be esolved as soon as possible .
special congatulations ae due to the appoteu , L@@ á@@ s@@ z@@ l@@ ó Su@@ j@@ án , fo esis@@ ting the temptation to be demago@@ gic about the milk fund , fo example , and fo doing his utmost and not attempting the impossible in ode to sell aboad .
just what we always wanted !
this county stands out fom the othe counties involved in the Easten Patneship on account of the efoms it has caied out in evey aea .
I shall wait and see what infomation I obtain in esponse to my questions fom the epot you will be publishing next week , and I eseve the ight to e @-@ table my question and ask fo specific answes to specific questions .
it is clea that an aangement must be made to inde@@ m@@ ni@@ fy the consume .
thank you Ieland .
on the subject of the Union &apos;s pioity enegy pojects , I should emphasise the impotance of the Southen Gas C@@ oi@@ do .
that is a defici@@ ency , because thee is a need fo test potocols to establish which of the hundeds of thousands of substances on the maket can cause the endo@@ c@@ ine @-@ disup@@ tive effects descibed .
I have no pat answe to this question .
the Euopean Union decided not to keep emegency stocks , a decision which will futhe incease speculation in the futue .
I would also like to thank M Au@@ dy , who dafted the opinion .
most Membe States ae a long way off the 7 % mak of development coopeation .
it should be positive about globalisation , but it should , above all , be sue to implement measues leading to moe new companies and new jobs .
this pocess is to be espected .
my justification fo this is as follows . on 14 Novembe we submitted a motion fo a esolution to the administation .
the cisis is fu@@ elled by weaknesses in the inteinstitutional equilibium and how state institutions function .
duing the wa in Kosovo , I expeienced just how much weight Euope can bing to bea in tems of possibilities fo shaping situation by political means , and in tems of possibilities fo pusuing a peventative foeign policy , a peventative peace policy , and fo esolving a conflict when the conflict has wosen@@ ed .
that is the way things ae .
consequently , Amendment No 31 is not acceptable .
the challenge fo the Bitish pesidency and the Austian and evey othe one that succee@@ ds is accep@@ tability .
M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , I think that the Mogan epot and my epot on a Euopean Chate on the Rights of Enegy Consu@@ mes must be consideed togethe .
clealy , the time available pemits me to make just a few obsevations .
this man is at the heat of patient mobility , because eveyone should be able to tavel aboad and eceive teatment , if they so wish , egadless of thei pay pac@@ ket o savings .
I fomally uge the Pesidency of Paliament to make the most of this oppotunity and to be pepaed fo a political conclusion next week .
unfotunately , the epot on K@@ .@@ 9 has been pesented so late that nothing new can be added and thee is no oom fo manoeuve befoe the Integovenmental Confeence e@@ vis@@ es the Teaty .
we did it apidly , and you can imagine the happ@@ iness this decision has ceated fo the people and leades of Geogia .
Dublin is not London !
I am fimly convinced , as ae many othes , that it is both possible and essential fo people fom diffeent cultues and eligions to live togethe in peace , both within the Euopean Union and in the wold at lage . paticula impotance attaches in this context to ou elations with the peoples on the opposite shoes of the Mediteanean and in the Middle East .
the Committee on Employment and Social Affais would also like to be sue that pesons who , because of national egulations , ae highly qualified pofessionals ae not disadvantaged by compaison with those who have a low level of qualification but the same job title .
the Commission and Paliament must be ste@@ ad@@ fast to suppot the deployment of so many Euopean foces , not least at pesent in South Lebanon , as this execise suely povides the geatest test fo the development of ou common foeign secuity and defence policy .
how ae they eve to stop being wal@@ ods if they ae constantly being supplied with money fom the op@@ ium economy ?
this poposal does not fully addess that question .
the wold is gowing close togethe outside the EU too and we should seek a constuctive patneship with the Cental Asian counties , a patneship that does not give the impession that Euopeans ae concened only with what is useful to them , a patneship founded on mutual advantage .
it is an excellent epot and we give it ou full backing , but it is egettable that , in my opinion , the waning panel , in paticula , is still athe unclea : a tian@@ gul@@ a panel with a ed bode and black lettes sp@@ elling &quot; ex . &quot;
on the othe hand , howeve , the necessay pocess of setting up the Tibunal to ty the ho@@ end@@ ous cimes of the K@@ h@@ me Rou@@ ge has gound to a halt .
it is not just individual citizens who fea poo guaantees of ights ; this also de@@ tes judges , but also police and posecu@@ tos , fom woking togethe , too .
Madam Pesident , N@@ EP@@ AD and its implementation agency , the Afican Union , offe , as all of us would agee , no quick fix fo the poblems of Afica .
in the same way , we can only endose sanctions against employes who esot to this type of labou , often to abuse it , and who ae nothing othe than moden @-@ day sla@@ ve tades .
as the Commissione knows , espect fo someone else &apos;s language , espect fo that peson and his o he cultue and customs , helps suppot the integation of those communities .
now , because of a poo Euopean Union policy , we have become a net suga impote ; that is the esult of in@@ competent decision @-@ making in Bussels .
Euope must go fowad ; Euope cannot stand still .
what ae the essential points ?
these people ae looking fo tempoay shel@@ te .
this must be made clea and , in this espect , the Commissione has been athe moe foth@@ ight in he comments than M Solana in ecent weeks .
that is one point .
I would also like to say that the pess nomally cay stoies , often befoe the meetings , on how the vaious states intend to vote on diffeent issues in the Council .
the Commission has identified all of the most poblematic actions of the peiod in question , without pejudice to the legal poceedings that the national couts have yet to complete . it estimates that appoximately 9 % of all the actions caied out o financed between 1990 and 1995 show iegulaities .

time and again in the vaious epots we see that it is in the inteests of the Union , in othe wods , of the public , to fomulate egulations in the geneal good .
- Repot ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 09 / 2004 ) by Ma@@ ie@@ ke S@@ andes @-@ ten Hol@@ te , on behalf of Paliament &apos;s Delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint texts appoved by the Conciliation Committee fo a egulation of the Euopean Paliament and the Council on :
thee is a mind@@ set that seems to think that a statement and a common position ae all that is needed .
the answe is an un@@ qualified yes .
the Geens have tabled a seies of amendments with a view to conve@@ ting the money spent on fusion to pomoting sustainable and enewable enegies .
I think that such expots should not be pemitted .
this in@@ consistency in many aeas of policy must be addessed in this pogamme fo 2008 .
we have theefoe tabled amendments to this effect elating both to the content and the methodology .
the difficulty of tying to find a system aimed at a minimum of taxation on savings income within the Euopean Union has been moe ke@@ en@@ ly appeciated as pogess has been made in libealising the movement of capital . this libealisation goes back some 12 yeas .
fist of all , it is a good idea .
we know that the egulations in both ageements with the USA and Austalia ae vey diffeent .
of couse , thee can be vaious easons fo this .
the fact that the elections had to be epeated in 17 constitu@@ encies is evidence of that .
- ( FR ) We ae being asked today to give ou opinion on the poposal fo the establishment of an intenational ciminal cout .
I have looked into this .
the Union must ensue that a caeful watch is kept fo Guatem@@ alan childen at the eceiving end , so to speak , and it must also suppot the aid pojects fo statutoy adoption pogammes in Guatemala itself .
she had vey stong and clea views , which wee not always shaed by eveyone .
helping each othe by pefec@@ ting evaluation methods between the diffeent counties , an exchange of good pactice , of couse we can but appove .
why is the Council taking a step backwads ?
that was not as a esult of the apa@@ th@@ eid @-@ style policies of the egime vis @-@ à @-@ vis women , but as the esult of the Taliban potection of M B@@ in Laden .
tagets may be set , fo example , by measuing the pecentage of women making up the labou foce and the unemployed , by assessing the extent to which the equal pay diective is being implemented and measuing the pecentage of women on decision @-@ making bodies .
Madam Pesident , yesteday , as we all know , thee was a mino incident hee duing the debate on the situation of Tukish pisones .
we knew long befoe all this stated that thee wee some weaknesses in the systems .
the Ameicans eally must see the pocess though and stop meely pushing national and egional inteests .
this illustates that it sometimes all takes longe sometimes than expected .
the isk assessment model is not ecognised by intenational oganisations esponsible fo food safety and public health such as the WHO , which consides it scientifically flawed .
the Commission statement on the EU esponse to the migation flows in Noth Afica and the Southen Mediteanean , in paticula , in Lampedusa , and
I would vey much like to emind you of the Euopean Sevices Diective : in ou view , it is a sell @-@ out and it does not achieve what you claimed a shot while ago .
natual disastes ae ten@@ ding to ec@@ u with inceasing fequency and with gowing intensity .
we want a full and thoough debate .
composition of committees and delegations : see Minutes
failue , an inability to each a satisfactoy compomise , would be , fo ou own citizens and above all fo the outside wold , the sign of a dangeous impasse .
as the honouable Membe will be awae a ministeial toika mission visited Al@@ gies on 19 @-@ 20 Januay 1998 .
I would undeline that this pocess should be caied out in an objective manne and we should not set impossible standads that might only lead to fustation among ou countepats .
the Council does not have any infomation on the conditions in eception centes .
is Commissione De Gucht going to infom his colleagues about the substance of the ageement at any stage ?
having said this , ou poposal leaves a doo open : when exceptional cicumstances aise elating to the volume of cago , the numbe of sevice povides may be esticted .
thus , the budget of the Socates pogamme is no@@ toi@@ ously inadequate .
that said , we poduce only 123 , 000 tonnes of honey .
Euope is not just the Euopean Union of today !
also yesteday , the Islamic C@@ outs vo@@ wed to pactice Sha@@ ia Law thoughout the county and , in paticula , in Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u .
we must appeal to egional and local authoities , as well as to all othe stakeholdes , and uge them to take advantage of this second chance .
fo example , Aticle 5.@@ 2 of the financial statement is entitled &apos; Val@@ ue @-@ added of Community involvement and coheence of the poposal with othe financial instuments and possible synegy &apos; .
the pensiones would be happy to know that thee is a epot addessing the issue of moe infomation and consultation fo pensiones , fo it is still the case today that some Euopean pensiones do not even know how lage thei pension will be the day befoe they stat to daw it , they do not know at what age they will be able to e@@ tie and they find the documents pesented to them totally incompehensible .
what will be the image of the Euopean Union if pessue is exeted ove the Cypus issue , if we ae told that , if thee is no date ight now , the Cypus issue will not be esolved ?
I believe that the poposals put fowad by the Commission ensue that we will have appopiate solutions should othe counties not subscibe to ou high level of ambition in mattes of envionmental potection .
ou concen is futhe inceased when we see the geat ha@@ ste and lack of thought which pevailed at the decision of 18 Decembe .
I must tell M Linkoh in paticula that it is not tue that we do not know when Chenobyl is going to be closed , because a date is set in the memoandum of undestanding : the yea 2000 .
this is most definitely to be commen@@ ded .
on such a subject it is only natual that many people should have had esevations and objections .
in connection with the CE mak , I am pleased that Paliament has gone its own way .
in ode to achieve the goals it has set itself , Euope must foge new v@@ isions and develop common actions that unite all its Membe States .
it is anticipated that in the nea futue the numbe of civil cisis management opeations will double .
howeve , I do welcome it , because despite its shotcomings it is a fist step and we can build on it in the futue .
M Papayannakis ightly poposes that the labelling should be compulsoy and that beef poducts , not just beef , should be included in its povisions .
to say we ae the biggest suppotes is in fact an undes@@ ta@@ tement .
Spinelli appeals to this House in these wods : &quot; in taking this initiative , we deive ou legitimacy fom ou status as the citizens &quot; and the community &apos;s elected epesentatives , as those who bea the actual esponsibility fo the Euopean democacy that is coming into being . &quot;
this is the basis of my fundamental fea .
you wee one of the foun@@ des of the New Patneship fo Afica &apos;s Development and you have spa@@ ed no effot to esolve the conflicts aging in numeous Afican counties , fom Madagas@@ ca to Côte @-@ d &apos;Ivoie , which has eaned you intenational espect .
the Membe States have in the past suppoted this good initiative of th@@ eis only with eluctance .
the Commission does , howeve , eseve the ight to expess its opinion on positions and poposals of govenments of Membe States duing the IGC and , in paticula , we shall be vigilant to ensue that the mandate is duly fulfilled .
Re@@ ven@@ ues fom natual gas ae an ongoing souce of tension .
we believe that the ceation of the Single Sky will espond to the inceasing demand fo ai safety .
can he become the Sa@@ int Fan@@ c@@ is that Euope needs in the Middle East ?
it eflects the need to help Membe States get the best out of taxpayes &apos; money - state aid is , at the end of the day , taxpayes &apos; money .
I believe that we must sal@@ ute his coheent and seious political tack ecod .

thee ae only a few hunded of these , while the vaious chaptes of title B of the budget cove tens of thousands of subsidies .
theefoe , the discussion we ae having at this point is how to bette motiv@@ ate the Membe States and how to bette calcul@@ ate the tagets so they ae moe pecise and bette monitoed in the futue .
the elections evealed that thee is no longe any place fo an opposition in Russia .
will the Commission ensue that common VAT egulations apply to all agicultual poduces in Romania ?
nevetheless , such a system is what is needed , and if thee ae waiting lists , it will be possible to eceive cae in anothe county .
the Un@@ es@@ co Convention must be applied not only to secuing cultual divesity with egad to thid counties , but also as a matte of the utmost ugency in ou own Euopean law .
the Commission intends to publish a geen pape on num@@ being befoe the end of this yea .
jobs will only be ceated by competitive famewok conditions and , as a esult , optimistic investos who ae willing to take a isk , and not by the wh@@ ing@@ eing of aff@@ lu@@ ent citizens .
thee is no questioning the fact , though , that the enlaged Community must be able to take action - at least in tems of li@@ p @-@ sevice .
I would ask you , C@@ his Patten , to take the floo .
this stategy will have to be sha@@ ped late on by each Membe State and will thus be assessed at local level .
ladies and gentlemen , the situation pevailing in the Middle East also takes us back to the need to accept ou esponsibilities at intenational level .
this is impotant .
in the inteests of openness and tanspaency , thee should be a clea beakdown and a clea outline of how much is going whee and what the esults ae .
.
it is also a pogamme which should give pioity to books in less widely used languages of the Euopean Union even if - and hee we disagee with the Council - those books have not peviously been tanslated into othe Community languages .
in westen Fance the stom caused the death of oughly 60 people and the disappeaance of a numbe of people , not to mention the destuction of seveal thousand homes .
we have stated , as the House knows , a seies of discussions with Ian .
( SK ) Thank you , M Pesident .
that is in the official ecod .
this is whee the heat and atei@@ es of evey Euopean ae at stake .
as a Social Democat , I am opposed to the EU being a &apos; ich man &apos;s club &apos; .
I think that we all , but also you , the Council and the Commission , should be concened about how Paliament can monito the system which we ae developing .
this is the issue .
M Pesident , I agee with a lot of what has been said so fa .
I ecognise that the acting political authoities have tied to adopt measues to impove govenance of the county , in contast to the obvious beakdown that occued duing the pesidency of K@@ um@@ ba Y@@ ala .
of couse , while South @-@ South tade has the potential to gow though the NA@@ MA negotiations , so too do ou own economies in tems of inceased tade with patnes acoss the wold .
unfotunately , ecent statements fom some people do not encouage optimism .
M Schulz spoke of this tension .
as I indicated befoe , the Commission wishes to continue exchanges with Paliament on the mod@@ alities and woking methods of the fund ove the coming peiod .
buildings ae absolutely cucial in enegy and climate policy .
you have descibed as a &apos; compomise amendment &apos; something which was not a compomise amendment .
this can be done most effectively by continuing to build on ou own defence identity in a dynamic manne , but also by caying out secuity tasks independently , in - fo example - Macedonia , and soon in Afica too .
they - they alone - have budget soveeignty behind closed doos .
I am convinced that involvement and co @-@ detemination ae a pat of the democati@@ zation of company law .
ou attempts to boost democacy in the county ae welcome , but it is a pity that we failed to mention any positive signs of democatic developments in the joint motion fo a esolution .
beyond the Congo &apos;s bodes , too - in Buundi and Rwanda - we have witnessed Afican genocide on a massive scale .
to educe it to fou months , as the Libeal Goup has poposed , and as appoved in committee , is entiely inconsistent .
all candidates had ageed befoehand the gound ules of the election .
it is tue that the Fench Govenment has allowed itself to become legally ta@@ pped by accepting the Teaty of Amstedam which depi@@ ves Fance of its ight to potect itself .
the next item is the joint debate on :
M Schulz , I do apologise but I do not fully undestand which pat of the Minutes you ae efeing to .
any suggestion that Ieland should be sha@@ med o even excluded fom the Union is fa moe damaging to Euope than the outcome of the efeendum itself .
they can multi@@ ply almost to infin@@ ity the ange of infomation and educational exchanges .
finally , the Innovation Union can be a eally good tool in ou wok to solve climate issues .
this issue , so often wongly pota@@ yed as a concen held exclusively by left @-@ wing paty @-@ political oganisations , is by natue an issue that consevative paties and politicians must be , and indeed ae , geatly concened about .
nonetheless , I cannot use my emaining seconds to denounce the human ights situation even futhe , because ou Paliament pe@@ fes to epeat eveything again and to place the emphasis on tightening sanctions again , while all the Membe States of the Euopean Union , including Bitain , keep on invo@@ king Aticle 3 , paagaph 3 of which states that exceptions should be made fo intenational meetings that have to be accommo@@ dated .
I cannot accept the connection made , in the Bösch epot , between the alleged lack of independence of UCLAF and its subodin@@ ation to the Secetaiat @-@ Geneal of the Commission .
thee ae cuently aound 2@@ 42 pisones held at Guantánamo .
how can we have a debate without the question , and without the autho of the question ?
the Commission has aleady initiated the fist payments unde the new convention .
the intepetation given by the UN legal advise ecognises the competence of Moocco to conclude these types of ageements and in this way implies that Moocco is a de facto administative powe of the teitoy of Westen Sahaa ; the mandate given to the Commission by the Council was to negotiate with the Kingdom of Moocco .
it is up to the govenment in B@@ atis@@ la@@ va to do what is necessay ; if not that county will have a poblem afte 1 May , with all the implications that this entails .
this doub@@ ling of the possibilities should be welcomed subject to one cucial condition : the two capitals should be equal in evey way , including finance .
the Intenet is viewed as a wild and dangeous ive and thee ae legislative initiatives in many states aimed at egulating its cuent .
they ae not elected to be spec@@ tatos o obseves at a tial , but to be legislatos , and that is what the public expect us to do .
these ae impotant measues that we can take .
to achieve this compliance with the legislation is essential .
futhemoe , when these dugs do exist and ae affodable , the populations in some cases do not have access to them , as they ae not adapted to the paticula sani@@ tation conditions in these counties .
the United Kingdom is a stong suppote of the Single Euopean Sky concept .
ladies and gentlemen , membes of the Council and the Commission , the challenges of the next few yeas ae impotant fo Euope and , I would add , fo the est of the wold .
the diffeence is that the US and China have the bigge makets , as they offe bette peconditions fo competition , competitiveness , new sevices , poducts and innovations .
I think that the essential thing is to sal@@ vage Oslo .
if we study the latest employment figues in the Cental Euopean counties , we see that employment has fallen eveywhee in 1999 and 2000 , except in Hungay , Lithuania and Slovenia .
just as thee ae music and football competi@@ tions at Euopean level , why not institute a Euopean &apos; open day &apos; fo small entepises ?
as both the Euopean Commission and the Euopean Cout of Auditos have highlighted , the cuent system is inefficient , expensive , complex , and it does not poduce the desied esults .
the esolution puts all the pessue on Russia , but thee is not one single efeence to the expansion of NATO to the east and the United States &apos; new missile system in Euope .
Hamas cannot even abide the ight of Isael to exist and thus un@@ le@@ as@@ hes endless el@@ ent@@ less teoist attacks upon its teitoy .
howeve , this diective - which was also suppoted by the Geek Govenment - intends to gant asylum seekes mateial facilities , which include accommodation , food and clothing , as well as a daily allowance which guaantees an adequate standad of living and sub@@ sis@@ tence fo the asylum seekes .
we ae awae , though , that thee ae a few poblems left outstanding , such as China &apos;s appoach to human ights , poblems that have to do with Taiwan and Tibet , and so my goup &apos;s position is that the conditions ae not yet in place that would allow us to lift this embago on China .
we welcome this contibution .
at the same time , the Commission is maintaining a vey close dialogue with Zimbabwe &apos;s neighbous , paticulaly the membes of the Southen Afican Development Community and the South Afican Govenment .
we ae dependent on unstable egions and counties with undemocatic egimes .
we need to know all these things .
in othe wods , it is &quot; yes ... but &quot; !

M Pesident , Commissione , M Sal@@ is , we cannot ovelook the pesence of the Commissione who is hee and who epesents the Commission .
thee ae thee conditions to be met .
I am talking about the eto@@ gade pocess which the development of democacy is undegoing both within the Euopean Union and on a global level .
we must state this quite clealy in full knowledge of the facts .
as you might emembe , we wee expecting about 1.5 million tonnes of quota to be enoun@@ ced in the fist yea and moe than 3 million tonnes in the second yea .
I agee with those who say that a lot can be done to impove co @-@ opeation between the existing legal systems but I am also convinced that we must be open to change whee this is equied .
the same applies to the poposal to calcul@@ ate esale ights on the basis of added value , in othe wods the diffeence between the esale pice and the sum paid to puchase the wok .
with an ageing population and as the need fo labou go@@ ws we must view taining and education , not just as a necessay evil , but as an investment in the futue .
I am pleased to say that afte the good exchange of views and coopeation up until now , most of you poposed amendments can be suppoted without eseve by the Commission .
in this Budget pocedue , then , we will take up ou positions , exet ou influence successfully , and make it clea to the public that what we have announced in the past we will stick to and make happen .
I have just listened to M Bus@@ ut@@ til and it is tue that , faced with the influx of immigants and asylum seekes , Membe States like Malta find themselves in extemely difficult situations .
Michael Fo@@ sy@@ th banned the flying of the Euopean F@@ lag in Scotland .
that is the best way of keeping the Membe States &apos; minds on the job .
this is not the case hee , since the olive secto has been opeating without any poblems , with impovements in quality in ecent yeas , and maintaining the gowes &apos; income .
indeed , the conclusions of this epot make no m@@ yste@@ y about aiving as quickly as possible at the total communi@@ ta@@ isation of the thid pilla .
thee is a vaiety of funding at national and EU level - such as agi @-@ envionment and Stuctual Funds - and this may be used to help with econ@@ vesion and in the management of its social impact fo a tansi@@ toy peiod .
howeve , if necessay , additional new funds will be made available fo scapping and fo social assistance .
although they ae not sufficient , the two vessels cha@@ teed by the Commission and othe measues taken with egad to fishing fo tuna in coastal wates wee decisive in educing tension and avoiding the sad events of 1994 .
I am quot@@ ing D@@ ante , and , much as it pa@@ ins me , I feel that the quo@@ tation is appopiate .
the open dialogue with the epesentatives of all the actos involved in this pocess lays at the basis of ou democatic system and epesents an impotant souce of infomation , povided that this happens in total tanspaency .
I would theefoe uge this House and the Council to addess the issue of esouces as soon as possible , fo the actions I have mentioned cannot be put off .
it is not simply a question of finding a single candidate .
the Commissione said to Euopean eseaches : we have passed the stage of you meeting to tell each othe what you ae doing and even to coopeate on fiendly tems .
but now , I believe , we must set about ch@@ ating ou couse fo the futue .
Paliament peviously called fo IS@@ O standad tan@@ spon@@ des to be used and fo the ow@@ ne &apos;s name and addess to be included .
this famewok decision equies Membe States to cimin@@ alise inten@@ tional conduct , such as public inci@@ tement to violence o hate towads a goup of people o pesons belonging to a goup defined on the basis of ace .
calenda of pat @-@ sessions : see Minutes
secondly , the situation fo poo counties can be impoved by giving them geate access to the Euopean maket fo poducts that ae essential to them .
this is the situation we cuently have in Cambodia and it is , unfotunately , in the vey sad tadition of this county . howeve , it would be vey questionable if we now took a isk and said that the Commission , and theefoe the Euopean Union , was willing to give Cambodia a sum of ECU 10@@ .5 million in aid to fight the elections .
it points out the objectives of the ageement ( development , stengthening of tade links between the EU and the Pacific ) and undelines the poblems aised by the deogation fom the ules of oigin fo pocessed fishey poducts .
I should like to know , on behalf of this House , why the Council feels it has no obligation to econ@@ su@@ l@@ t us .
but is it a militay supe@@ powe that the peoples of Euope need ?
this is paticulaly impotant to enable us to deal with the poblem of the &apos; woking poo &apos; .
the aim to help small businesses that take pat in the single maket and pofit fom it , and the desie to potect childen against the negative effects of the single maket , go without saying .
M Pesident , I am sue all those who have taken the floo today would agee that although any infingement of human ights is a teible thing , infingements of the ights of childen ae paticulaly ho@@ if@@ ying . cetain figues have been quoted .
I theefoe believe that the Ageement eached with the United States could lead to a pofound change to ou wine @-@ making cultue , which would not always wok to ou advantage , because , fotunately o unfotunately , the commecial success of ou wines has always been linked to a poduction method that con@@ foms igoously to the most pu@@ ist definitions of the wine .
tade ageements o business contacts with China cannot act as tade goods to di@@ sta@@ ct Euope &apos;s attention away fom the seious discimination fom which the Tibetan people still suffe .
I voted in favou of this esolution , which identifies poposals to be communicated to the Ukainian authoities .
the idea that men can only make a choice because a woman disc@@ loses a bit of epi@@ dem@@ is does , I think , make the male the idiculous figue .
we should not leave that issue to a decision by the couts on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis ; othewise we would end up with all kinds of conflicting esults .
a massive cedit c@@ unch .
again , why would the Commission appove something which would ham the possibilities fo small and medium @-@ sized entepises to get capital ?
I had the oppotunity to eview its poposal , and it is cetainly a step in the ight diection .
it is theefoe high time , in 1997 , fo a diective to be adopted , which finally obliges the employe and no longe the pla@@ inti@@ ff , to pove that the diffeence in salay between men and women does not aise fom a diffeence of gende .
M Pesident , the epot deals with a most difficult subject : the pospects fo young people in the faming industy , as the appoteu has indicated , ae pobably wose than at any time since the ceation of the CAP and thei pospects cannot be sepaated fom those of the industy as a whole o fom the pospeity of the ual communities .
my question is : how does the Council view the Commissione &apos;s specific poposal : in a positive o negative light ?
militay dictatoship continues to ule by foce , despite ecent ceasefie talks and ageements .
in this egad , I should like to point out that the Commission &apos;s statement efes to studies that the Membe States ae to cay out .
we will see what happens , theefoe , eithe in this Paliament when you pact with the euo@@ sceptics has fallen though , o at the polls in Fance in 2010 and in Gemany in 2013 , whee I think the votes will agee with us .
the Commission must explain how it will ensue this money will be ecove@@ ed , especially in cases whee pojects have not been accepted though the use of ten@@ deing pocedues .
on behalf of the PSE Goup . - ( ES ) M Pesident , the fact that we ae hee , at this late hou , discussing the common fame of efeence , is an indication that at least those of us who ae hee have a stong inteest in this issue , and the Commissione heself has indicated the inteest that she and othe Commissiones have in the matte .
as veteinay medicinal poducts used fo the theapeutic teatment and the welfae of animals which ae destined fo human consumption may give ise to esi@@ dues of such poducts in food @-@ poducing animals , a isk assessment of the safety limit of esi@@ dues of all phamac@@ ologically active substances contained in veteinay poducts needs to be caied out .
nonetheless , I think that the Committee &apos;s poposal is a good one .
the last of these exten@@ sions has aleady been adopted and expi@@ es on the 3@@ 1@@ st of this month .
in the case of non @-@ umin@@ ants , conves@@ ely , thee is no dange to human health and the envionment and we theefoe hope that this ban may be ove@@ tuned with the aim of offeing these animals a geate possibility of highe @-@ enegy die@@ ts .
without pope nutition , nothing can pevent the spead of AIDS no cue the people caying the disease .
as my colleague , M Duff , said , the Goup of the Euopean Libeal , Democat and Refom Paty suppots M Cobett &apos;s wok and his effots to simplify and tighten up the pocedues and make them moe focused .
the Council has aleady made pogess in this diection by adopting , with the exception of the United Kingdom and Sweden , a poposed exchange @-@ ate mechanism based on the EM@@ S .
this is the eason I wanted to stess the impotance of you vote ove this package because , ove and above its actual contents , it epesents a political message sent out by the Euopean institutions .
it is also unlikely that we will catch up with the United States and Japan in the nea futue .
12 . potection of copyight and cetain elated ights ( codi@@ fied vesion ) ( vote )
they povide an indication of the degee of consensus eached .
but fo those of us who have been pointing to the United States as an example of a de@@ egulated and libealised economy , it has been a sha@@ tteing blow to see the way in which Pesident Bush , faced with the difficulties that his steel industy is encoun@@ teing , has gone fo potectionism .
Spain has said yes to a Euope united in its divesity .
M K@@ ahme citicised the position of the Euopean People &apos;s Paty ( Chistian Democats ) and Euopean Democats , which questioned some compomises .
in this espect , we will also take account of Membe States &apos; analysis .
the govenments of Nothen Cypus and Tukey have followed the steps laid out by the United Nations and the EU .
to sum up , I will add that we have dawn up an intevention pogamme , which stictly obseves competences - not simply Community competences , but Membe States &apos; competences as well .
( SK ) Madam Pesident , I egad it as vey impotant fom a political pespective that the guidelines fo the 2012 budget eflect the economic and political cicumstances unde which it was dawn up .
in many cities , people have become involved who would not othewise paticipate .
- befoe the vote :
thidly , I can confim that the Commission will povide guidance on the compatibility of multilateal , inte@@ bank emuneation with competition ules .
the individual institutions that ae ecipients of Temp@@ us gants , acknowledge feely the debt they pay to this pogamme and to the Union in geneal .
in othe wods pot state contol authoities will have to inspec@@ t cetain types of ships in cetain ways .
applause
national govenments might one day , eventually , be able to und@@ o the EU &apos;s i@@ dio@@ tic policies on agicultue , fishing , commece and finance , but if the EU manages to take contol of defence thee may be consequences that cannot be und@@ one .
its main ecommendations ae that all patients should have access to infomation fee of chage , any advetising fo beast im@@ plants should cay a health waning , su@@ gi@@ cal opeations should be vey stictly monitoed , a database on im@@ plants should to be set up , eseach and development should be undetaken and thee should be a ban on beast im@@ plants caied out fo a@@ es@@ thetic easons in patients unde 18 yeas of age .
we need to eflect on the poposal to exempt the pel@@ a@@ gic fleet fom the ban on ne@@ tting y@@ an ove 8 m@@ m .
I would like to stat by saying that I think it is impotant to point out that the tele@@ com@@ s package , as it stands today pio to the vote , is essentially a good one .
the intenational community has been actively following the developments and the initiatives of Moscow .
by voting &apos; no &apos; , did the Iish mean that solidaity with the pooest counties , fom which they have significantly and ightly benefited in ecent decades , is no longe elevant and that the ule fom now on is evey man fo himself ?
as Ms Oomen @-@ Ruijten has stated , wok with the Euopean Commission was also pefectly feasible .
the diective is a eal theat .
in any case , the Ba@@ z@@ in epot takes some pecep@@ tible steps in that diection .
they do not do this because they have to , but because they want to .
we had moe than 300 contibutions fom Membe States , egional authoities , oganisations epesenting patients and pofessionals as well as healthcae povides - even hospitals and individual citizens .
of couse they will e @-@ elect him and then we will have him back again .
as you can imagine , this is a fequent item on the agenda in tansatlantic discussions and it was aised just last week at the Euopean Union / United States Summit in Washington .
anothe thing you can ead in this epot is that the futhe gowth of ai tanspot will depend on it being CO2 @-@ neutal .
I shall cite no moe than the witten question on this subject submitted by my colleague M H@@ ap@@ pat in May 1990 , and the Agicultue Commissione &apos;s subsequent b@@ land eply .
we ae talking about a single asylum aea and the integated efugee management policy that we need .
we just have to emembe the thousands of people made disabled evey yea by accidents at wok o on the oads .
the othe Membe States have bilateal visa ageements with Bazil , allowing thei nationals to ente Bazil fo shot sta@@ ys without a visa .
unfotunately , the Council &apos;s nuclea woking goup did not believe that these wee issues which had a place on the agenda .
even if the utili@@ zation ates ae not always vey encouaging , URBAN is one of the moe successful Community initiatives , because it is paticulaly close to local people and above all because it involves citizens fom vaious local goups and has thus been a stong motiv@@ ating foce .
I might imagine that you have concluded that this is theefoe a decision .
natually , we cannot just dop one element and add anothe .
so fa as fisheies ae concened , I head vey clealy what Ms Langen@@ hagen had to say and we have always been pepaed to suppot fisheies and the scapping of ships whee necessay .
hence ou suppot fo this epot , despite the measues aleady taken in this field by the Council .
( DE ) M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission adopted the peliminay daft budget fo 2004 - a histoic budget that will , fo the fist time , cove an EU of 25 Membe States - on 30 Apil and I pesented the peliminay daft hee in plenay session on 13 May .
in witing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democats agee that migation flows as a esult of instability constitute a challenge fo the EU and that inceased effots ae equied to deal with the causes of the instability and stuctual poblems in the counties of oigin .
the UN Su@@ b @-@ Commission on the Pom@@ o@@ tion and Potection of Human Rights came to this conclusion seveal yeas ago , yet so fa no action has been taken to estict o pohibit them .
it is the most eliable method fo ensuing that tuna is dol@@ p@@ hin safe .
whee do they supposedly was@@ h thei hands , while using this netwok fo thei detainees ?
cetain ules ae equied , and tanspaency is essential .
it is of couse a matte fo eget that the global one pe cent incease was not adopted , but the EU now has the chance to live out and demonstate , within its own bodes , the way in which convesion to enewable enegy souces makes eveyone a winne , in that , by doing so , we will not only be mi@@ tig@@ ating climatic disaste , but will also be ceating five times as many jobs as we would with taditional use of enegy , peseving esouces aound the wold , using enewable enegy souces to develop technologies that we can expot .
. I thank the honouable Membe fo this impotant question .
I would , howeve , like to daw you attention to a few aspects which might stand in the way of achieving the tasks advanced in the diective .
these epots ae ancho@@ ed to a lage extent in the boade philosophy of libealising and pivati@@ sing makets and public sevices .
it is , howeve , questionable whethe it eally is ight fo the diective to make ecommendations to the competent social patnes , as has been suggested , fo example , in one amendment .
the ejection of the Bittan plan was intended to thow dus@@ t in the eyes of all those who eacted sten@@ u@@ ously to the ceation of a new tansatlantic maket which would put woking people in Euope in an even moe difficult position .
.
thank you .
this is why I call on the EU Membe States and the ACP counties that have not yet atified the Intenal Ageement and the Amen@@ ded Cotonou Ageement to do so , in the hope that the fund can become opeational as soon as possible .
whee , fo example , ae all those sick touists now on which these highe standads ae based ?
this pospect should give new impetus to stengthening the egional integation pocess .
thee is now something called the Joint Paliamentay Assembly of the ACP and EU , the only paliamentay assembly in the wold which does not look at a budget .
I believe it is pematue to come up with eady made fomul@@ as and answes at this stage .
had this been the case , the Euostat issue would not have occued on this scale .
Aticle 2 of the EU @-@ Isael Association Ageement will continue to emind both the Euopean Union and Isael that espect fo human ights and democatic pinciples ae the basis of ou bilateal elations .
if the Commission concludes that the application meets the equiements fo egistation , the name and a summay of the speci@@ fication will be published in the Official Jounal of the Euopean Union .
witten statements ( Rule 142 )
( PL ) M Füle , I would like to thank you fo this infomation , but I must aise two issues .
today we again uge the Council and Commission to continue to take whateve action is necessay to demand the elease of political pisones and pisones of conscience .
Lind@@ q@@ vist ( ELDR ) , Gahton , Hol@@ m , Schöling ( V ) , in witing .
we want to defend them and will fight fo thei ights .
the Commission thus does not have competence and is theefoe not in a position to intevene in the way police foces in the Membe States maintain public ode on thei own teitoies .
as a esult , a highe Benne toll will be possible .
with egad to the highly ove@@ valued euo exchange ate , it is tue that it is spa@@ ing us the wost in the face of ising oil pices .
we ae about to discuss the appointment of the Boad of the Cental Bank .
this is a Community that we need to conside as a whole , not letting anyone be disciminated against .
we do not want to ceate any new local employment initiatives in competition with SMEs ; such action should be taken as a paallel effot accompanying in a fai and balanced manne ou pomotion of small and medium @-@ sized entepises .
we know that thee ae some who ae not genuine but let us make sue that in tying to exclude those we do not fail in ou duty to help those who ae in genuine need because of the pesecution they ae suffeing .
enabling women to take pat in woking life will actually contibute to economic gowth , but I would not like to conclude without ec@@ alling the geat sevice which women do to thei families and all of those women who help thei woking spouses despite the fact that they do not figue in the statistics and that the Euopean Union has only been dealing with thei situation since 1986 .
I have a question : could it be that , following the example of he pedecesso Chancello Ge@@ had Scho@@ ede , Ms Mekel was looking fo a job with Gazpom ?
I have aleady mentioned that the UN special appoteu has a paticula ole to play hee .
the epot of the Euopean Council and the declaation of the Commission on the Cologne Euopean Council meeting of 3 and 4 June , -@@ the declaation of the Council concening the six months of the Geman Pesidency .
it is thus logical fo us to hold a joint debate on the 1996 employment epot and on the amendment to the Euopean Union &apos;s most impotant social insuance legislation - Regulation 1408 .
I will add that M Baón Cespo also said something that I will ead out , which was taken down fo me fom the tape .
allow me theefoe to expess my de@@ light that the Council , thanks I might add to the peseve@@ ance of ou appoteu , Ms Re@@ don@@ do J@@ im@@ é@@ nez , is now finally acknowledging , at least to some extent , that ou aguments ae valid .
but in the talks on the matte that is still unde@@ ci@@ ded .
the fouth issue concens ending the an@@ dom opeation of the common agicultual policy ( CAP ) by implementing a system@@ ic oganisation of the policy with a focus on long @-@ tem objectives .
M Pesident , the holding of an extaodinay Council on employment , at the equest of the Fench govenment , puts this question at the cente of the debate , along with a social dimension to Euopean constuction which has until now been lacking .
in the absence of an association ageement in foce , the Euopean Union has no platfom fo an in @-@ depth dialogue on human ights with Syia whee it could also discuss citical issues - and thee ae many to be discussed - such as the ab@@ og@@ ation of emegency ule , the amendments to the laws on politically pati@@ s@@ an NGOs , the ganting of citizenship to sta@@ tel@@ ess Kuds o the setting @-@ up of a national council on human ights .
7 . futue of the Afica / EU stategic patneship on the eve of 3@@ d Afica / EU summit (
it is ou task and duty to encouage the political leades in Kosovo to assume thei esponsibilities and to ceate democatic political institutions which espect the ights and feedoms of all citizens in the context of a mul@@ tie@@ th@@ ni@@ c Kosovo which lives in good @-@ neighbou@@ ly elations with its neighbous .
thank you vey much , M Fischle .
it was the oot of the poblem with the Sante Commission .
Madam Pesident , it is always temp@@ ting to e@@ wite histoy , but the facts always tend to emain ob@@ stin@@ ately the facts , and the fact is that the Euopean Paliament has by no means always played the ole it should have done in the events since August which have now led to the esignation of the Commission .
moeove , the sale of many bands enabled it to tun aound its financial situation as ealy as the autumn of 2010 and to egain its listing on the stock maket in Novembe 2010 .
thee is , fifthly , a need fo a pu@@ po@@ se@@ ful and stuctued dialogue with civil society , and I hope that the Pesidency &apos;s poposals in this egad will find suppot among the vaious govenments .
ICT places new demands on education , and theefoe also on teaches .
moeove , the afoementioned activities ae usually the pel@@ u@@ de to a moe systematic pene@@ tation of the maket of the state in question .
I conside this pocedue to be vey unfai to the appoteu .
he has been stuggling now fo six yeas with the Spanish couts and we have not had any help yet , effectively , fom this Paliament .
listening to this debate , whee the wods &apos; am@@ as@@ sage &apos; and &apos; fon@@ t@@ loading &apos; ae being used so often , it seems as though they have become pat of the eveyday le@@ xi@@ c@@ on of ou budget language .
that does not bo@@ the me , howeve .
finally , a vey bief efeence to Opeation A@@ tem@@ is .
what gives him the ight to estict a Membe &apos;s feedom of action ?
I have just head that in the othe vesions which you did not mention these omis@@ sions o eos wee not made .
it is tue ; the Stockholm Pogamme has stongly stated this pinciple : 250 000 applications have been made in the last two yeas , which is a lage numbe , although lowe in the last efeence yea .
it will also bing equality to patient cae , with all citizens , ich o poo , known o unknown , having access to bette teatment aboad as necessay .
although the inceased numbe of agencies is , in geneal , positive , the tuth is that it ceates challenges egading the monitoing and evaluation of thei pefomance .
since the vote in the plenay confimed the appoteu &apos;s choice to boaden the scope of the diective , the Fench socialists voted against the text as a whole .
the volume of taffic and numbe of passenges tavelling though S@@ tans@@ ted Ai@@ pot , which fo the most pat is vey welcome within my constituency of Noth E@@ sse@@ x and South Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k , is inceasing and obviously passenges want to know that thei safety is a paamount consideation .
I would like to do that and I am awae that thee ae no cuent ules in existence and theefoe the situation may be somewhat difficult .
fo how long can the Membe States waste thei esouces befoe you finally popose , in Council , the inquiy the Euopean Paliament has long been demanding ?
as egads the payments , most of them oigin@@ ate fom the peiod between 2000 and 2006 .
finally , I believe that we in the Euopean Paliament should stengthen evey effot which shows the Euopean taxpaye in times of cisis that this House is spending what it needs ation@@ ally so that it can do a bette job .
have nothing to do with this , Pime Ministe !
we theefoe have the oppotunity fo ou actions to be much moe effective and focused , and to be able to tanslate ou actions into a tue patneship fo enewal .
ou aim should be to enhance consume potection in those places whee legal chaos and uncetainty have pevailed so fa , atta@@ cting a vaiety of co@@ o@@ ks and undemining confidence in the intenal maket .
I theefoe call once again on Tunisia to stat pacti@@ sing its pofes@@ sed faith in human ights at long last .
they have noted that the use of cetain co@@ ated seeds leads to a eduction in the size of s@@ w@@ ams and thus a eduction in the poduction of honey .
how can we speak of fundamental ights , howeve , when the ight to employment and the ight to a decent salay ae not guaanteed because decision belongs to a mone@@ yed minoity who have the ma@@ j@@ estic powe to close thei businesses and pl@@ un@@ ge thei employees into povety ?
in addition , it is vital to pomote mutual undestanding and knowledge between peoples and cultues , though specific actions on vaious fonts .
secondly , I am opposed to the national en@@ vel@@ ope .
anything else would mean that we had leaned nothing fom past decades , and I ask that that be taken to heat once and fo all .
the high levels of bee motality caused by the Va@@ o@@ a mi@@ te and the unesolved poblem of col@@ ony collapse diso@@ de will unfotunately not go away .
he had to wok vey had , having to con@@ tend with 6@@ 30 pages of statistical mateial fom 2005 and 2006 on the fight against faud .
the epot epesents a stimulus to the Commission , a contibution to the Lisbon Stategy , a call fo Euope to go up a gea if we want to join the top level and with@@ stand competitive pessue fom China and the United States in paticula .
enomous damage was done to wide stet@@ ches of beach , e@@ efs wee destoyed , thei coal filled with s@@ and and dit , and machiney was@@ hed out to sea constitutes a ti@@ cking time @-@ bomb .
howeve , in the light of ecent developments we must look paticulaly closely at the wok@@ ings of the Commission .
a commendable new fom of &apos; inte @-@ faith &apos; dialogue !
that paticipation will itself en@@ gende futhe impotant efoms in Russia , which ae necessay fo Russia &apos;s paticipation and enjo@@ yment of the benefits of the wold economy in the ful@@ le sense , and that will bing benefits in the Baltic egion and elsewhee .
the Euopean Paliament has held many debates on this issue and only this yea adopted thee esolutions on the death penalty .
they ae aleady being abandoned , to a degee , and it looks like this will intensify in futue .
if you have them both voted on togethe , you may well end up with a esult that this House does not want in the least , and so I ask that we vote item by item .
I hope that othe goups can suppot the aim of this amendment .
Recently , thee have been some encouaging signals .
on the othe hand , a stong egional stategy is also necessay .
M Pesident , the mom@@ ent@@ ous events in Noth Afica may have pofound consequences fo good o bad fo the futue pospeity and peace of westen civilisation , but we ae watching the outcome of a pocess that began 40 yeas ago .
instead , we should continue to monito the possibility that legislative dispaities between Membe States could have an economic impact .
howeve , M Pesident , the latest scan@@ nes ae additional secuity tools .
how justified it is is de@@ ba@@ table .
only stable and long @-@ tem suppot fo local communities in the pooe egions accompanied by maximum steam@@ lining of pocedues will make it possible to even out the dispaities and allow us to speak of eal competition within the Euopean Union ove the next decade o so .
the Membe States ae happy about that , but it is not good budgetay pactice .
thee is a feedom and a fes@@ h@@ ness in this which I like vey much .
- ( CS ) Madam Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , I have voted against the Floenz epot .
the situation is completely out of contol .
people ae quite simply afaid of mass immigation to Euope following the majo events in Noth Afica ecently .
as fa as pinciples ae concened , the changes elating to the institutional political famewok and to the commecial and financial ules seem to us to be an impovement .
it is a comfot to the fames of the Euopean Union that within Paliament thee ae voices that ae sympa@@ thetic and well @-@ infomed .
in woking towads a common policy fo fifteen counties and ultimately twenty @-@ five , thee will always be some vai@@ ations in detail .
in setting up the single maket we foget that if such an intenal maket is to be acceptable it also has to have a social dimension .
the &apos; E@@ ve@@ y@@ thing but ams &apos; initiative , theefoe , to some extent offset the sl@@ ump obseved in 2001 and 2002 .
I am soy that this is complicated , but life sometimes is complicated .
duing othe sessions , we have talked about othe counties .
in the past , the State would intefee in people &apos;s choice of patne and ban mai@@ ages between people of cetain eligions and between people of diffeent aces .
thank you Pime Ministe S@@ ó@@ cates .
( it ) M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission tiggeed the adioactive isk alet system yesteday following an incident at K@@ sk@@ o in Slovenia , the details of which emain s@@ ket@@ ch@@ y .
I found that some of the labelling that was identified in the pogamme indicated that the paticula poduct was 65 % chi@@ cken .
thee is an ugent need fo action at EU level , howeve .
I have listened with geat inteest to what paliamentaians have said tonight in this debate because the Euopean Extenal Action Sevice is a subject that a@@ ous@@ es pas@@ sions .
the United Kingdom and Gemany , fo example , ae among them .
intenational social law should now be subject to chages fo entepises on the fee intenal maket .
indeed , it is estimated that the numbe of passenges using business aviation could double in the next ten yeas o so .
as you may ecall , the talks began on 3 Octobe 2005 o , to be pecise , 4 Octobe , because it was late at night o ealy in the moning , depending on the definition in Luxemboug .
I know that the vaious cultues in the Membe States diffe in thei handling of this issue .
the time has come fo this Paliament to say to Hamas : &apos; R@@ ecognise the State of Isael , negotiate with it , end the anti @-@ Sem@@ i@@ tic views of you chate and then we can stat the peace pocess &apos; .
last week , Euopean society expeienced two events .
histoically , atistic studies wee linked to education duing the ealie yeas .
1 . Pakistan - mude of Sha@@ h@@ ba@@ z B@@ ha@@ tti , Ministe fo Min@@ oities
between 2002 and 2006 , which is the time scale fo the Union &apos;s coopeation stategy with Guatemala , we intend to step up action on human ights and the fight against intimidation and impunity .
thee is the fact that aound half of the people who now have AIDS and ae dying of the disease ae women .
Paliament should suppot civil society in Mexico , which is asking fo this un@@ constitutional povision to be changed .
thee ae vaious Membe States - as my fellow Membe has just said - which ae not paticulaly inclined to standadi@@ se soil potection at Euopean level .
I want to talk about tax havens like Gibalta as well .
moeove , unde the Teaties , the Community institutions have no powes in militay affais .
we must also make it ou concen that moe languages ae taught and leaned in highe education institutions .
lastly , Tukey is afaid that new citeia othe than the political Copenhagen citeia will be imposed .
that is why I welcome the Commission poposal to set up a apid eaction mechanism alongside the militay unit and to supplement ECHO .
Madam Pesident , on behalf of my goup , I should like to table an oal amendment to this paagaph .
the outcome was vey close ; opinions dive@@ ge widely and it still emains to be seen how the plenay will finally vote in July .
you active involvement in this foum ove the last fou yeas has indeed pomoted Euopean values and I can only thank you as Membes of Paliament fo this , as well as fo the excellent coopeation between ou institutions .
it is also clea that the Italian and the Fench authoities have , at last , found a common language in which to popose solu@@ tion@@ s@@ and have invested almost EUR 300 million , the buden being shaed equally by the two counties , to ensue safety .
on the question concening the Baltic Sea , thee is no doubt , as I said in a pevious eply , the maitime policy needs to take into account the specific featues o chaacteistics of the diffeent maitime egions of the Euopean Union .
we think that the poduction of this Euopean heitage should emain pemitted in a contolled envionment .
the Euopean Commission also uses analyses by intenational bodies .
( SK ) The In@@ no@@ v@@ ative Medi@@ c@@ ines Initiative is a unique initiative insti@@ gated by the Euopean Commission and the Euopean Fedeation of Pha@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical In@@ dus@@ ties and As@@ soci@@ ations , which will have a budget of EUR 2 billion to 2013 .
to begin with , I would like to congatulate M Buzek fo his excellent wok , which will be instu@@ mental in at@@ taining the Lisbon Stategy goals .
I would like to pesent biefly the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetay Affais , and I do not want to devote myself to long explanations about why small and medium @-@ sized entepises ae the economic backbone of Euopean society .
indeed we ae facing the dilemma of on the one hand ecognising a humanitaian obligation and wanting to help , while on the othe we know that in the county we want to help we come up against stuctues that often stand in the way of achieving the pupose of the aid .
the choice of which of the two sites to poduce in was an indication of the difficulties that we wee going to have to face on behalf of the Iish wokes .

politicians and states should undetake to teach citizens that pivacy is something to be potected ; just as one needs to lock up and secue one &apos;s own home , today it is just as impotant to secue ou electonic devices , and thei means of communi@@ cating with the wold , to the same extent .
ove and above those tems , though , what is thee of any substance in it ?
as a geneal ule , they possess fewe esouces than the majo Ameican univesities , fo example .
it is theefoe impotant fo the Membe States to develop a wide netwok of ceti@@ fied multi@@ disciplinay beast units which meet specific quality citeia .
Estonia and Poland ae included , whose membeship would stengthen the Union &apos;s nothen dimension .
patenting has to aid the Euopean economy and Euopean citizens .
it is now a question of making pogess with the necessay potection and assistance fo victims , the fight against illegal contacting by employes , the confis@@ cation of the poceeds fom this tafficking and of the means of tanspot used , and to make it obligatoy fo tanspo@@ tes to meet the costs of the epatiation of foeignes who do not meet the equiements fo legal enty .
futhemoe , I believe that thee is a fundamental poblem of attitude .
baely thee months ago , this House adopted a epot on implementation of the Sevices Diective , in which we daw attention pincipally to the fact that the one @-@ stop shops ae not fully opeational , that in most cases , they do not allow completion of fom@@ alities by electonic means and that they ae not woking in the way which businesses expect .
the Minutes of today &apos;s sitting will be submitted to Paliament fo its appoval at the beginning of its next sitting .
I too would like to join Ms McGuinness in thanking the Commissione fo an excellent and inteesting esponse .
subject : tanspaency with egad to management pay
fist of all , it emem@@ bes the victims , all the victims , and pays tibute to all those who wok voluntaily to put the fies out .
do they not want it ?
these ae , howeve , objectives equiing the safeguad of pesonal inteests , with compliance with ules and a hamonization of citeia .
consequently , I made some public statements saying that , in ou opinion , the task was theefoe not as difficult as negotiations concening cetain estuctuing plans fo othe financial institutions in many Membe States .
I might mention in passing that I welcome the fact that the Committee on Budget &apos;s vaious amendments and esolutions show its desie to look into the agicultual secto moe deeply , including with egad to the Mid@@ tem Review , which is due next yea .
I believe this is an issue which we must discuss vey caefully between the fist and the second ead@@ ings .
we examined the customay documents , M Pesident , including the declaation on in@@ compatibility and the declaation of financial inteests .
what can we do if that happens ?
will you be able to guaantee that we too shall not be expoting what is efeed to as nuclea fuel unde unacceptable conditions ?
the intenal maket stategy 2003 @-@ 2006 sets out exactly what needs to be done by whom and by when .
the Commission is the guadian of Euopean Union law . it is time fo this guadian to do its duty and not give in to Membe States , but instead to ensue compliance with the laws that we have jointly adopted .
what is fas@@ cin@@ ating fo me is that the annual epots show that we ae making pogess on the vey issues which the Euopean Paliament has aised .

in ode to do that , we have , of couse , stated with the child .
thee is ageement that it is desiable to agee the evision in time fo 1 Januay 2002 so that the benefit to the faming community can come in as quickly as possible .
that is the position of the Goup of the Paty of Euopean Socialists .
the EDF coves five yeas .
in addition to that , the legislative poposals of the Commission in the aea of asylum and immigation ae getting nowhee , because decision @-@ making in the Council has come to a stand@@ still .
howeve , we would like to stess that we do not conside educed ates of value added tax to be a solution to the poblem of a &apos; black &apos; economy .
so we come to Kashmi , Asia &apos;s numbe one touble spot , a poblem da@@ gged out fom 19@@ 47 onwads , with the divided Kashmi , called J@@ amm@@ u @-@ Kashmi , ton between Pakistan and India .
I would also like to tell M Tillich that we ae well awae of the fact that these dele@@ tions fom the budget , and even these eductions of payment appopiations ae a matte fo discussion , but I do not accept that thee should be any doubts cast on the detemination of the Council to honou the obligations of the Euopean Union .
sanctions will be suspended when Saddam complies with cetain conditions , pimaily in elation to the monitoing of his weapons of mass destuction capacity .
the Commission has done a good job and on this I offe it my congatulations .
the UN Food and Agicultue Oganization has stated that two @-@ thids of the wold &apos;s species , including cod , lob@@ ste , pa@@ wns and sh@@ im@@ ps ae fis@@ hed to capacity .
on the othe hand , we should consolidate a pemanent flow of basic infomation fo the citizen .
finally , paagaph 4 states that social and integation policies ae cental to citizens &quot; ights and also to economic development , which is entiely coect .
this secto is vey impotant .
I just want to ask you sevices to give it on the basis of the mid@@ day debate .
( RO ) I believe that evey Membe State must be pepaed to join the euo aea in ode to avoid extemely sevee potential advese effects on the national economy .
I would like to ask M Baot a question : why , afte a popula efeendum in Switzeland said &apos; no &apos; to min@@ ae@@ ts , did the Euopean Commission , the Euopean Union , the United Nations , the Aab League and the Oganisation of the Islamic Confeence all ally ound to condemn the outcome of that efeendum - even though Switzeland is not a membe of the Euopean Union - yet today , you ae taking a neutal position ove a question which concens ou oots , ou identity and ou soul ?
hence , the guidelines on ve@@ tical esta@@ ints which povide fo an intepetation of Regulation ( EC ) No 2@@ 7@@ 90 / 1999 make it clea that &apos; evey distibu@@ to must be fee to use the Intenet to adveti@@ se o to sell poducts &apos; .
by contast , South Afica &apos;s political and economic suppot fo Mugabe &apos;s ule and the expulsion of Z@@ imbab@@ we@@ an efugees fom South Afica ae contay to ou shaed values .
the next item is the debate on topical and ugent subjects of majo impotance .
afte all , even befoe 11 Septembe no one was awae to what extent fundamental ights wee being wh@@ it@@ tled away with the ageement of westen democats .
in the case of olde wokes the emphasis was on the need to intoduce an integated stategy based on quality jobs and specialist taining .
the eview is suppoted by G@@ 10 and now has the suppot of the Membe States .
thee have ecently been intensive and geneally positive developments in the egion .
this pioity encomp@@ asses such mattes as : focusing EU institutional expenditue on fundamental tasks ; suppoting equests fo new pemanent positions fom the budget only afte having assessed the possibility of e@@ distibuting esouces and staff within the famewok of the existing budget ; suppoting new initiatives only afte having assessed thei impact on the budget and inteinstitutional coopeation with a view to econom@@ ical and effective use of budget esouces .
in some cases we have had to do so twice : we have had a fist consultation , and if we wee not satisfied with the esponses that we eceived then we have issued a second Geen Pape .
M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , a change is necessay in the way in which we pusue coopeation between the Euopean Union and the ACP counties , with a view to establishing a enewed , eal and faie patneship .
in the futue we intend to gathe such infomation in a moe stuctued manne .
a numbe of obsevations on the substance of the specific pogammes beas out the geneal comments made above :
befoe we vote , M Pesident , just a few comments on this egulation on behalf of the Goup of the Paty of Euopean Socialists .
but above all , thee is a need to adopt eal and effective measues to eadicate the violence , so that it ce@@ ases to be a topic fo paliamentay debate .

so you should not be so woied about it and about atification by Paliament .
the economic and envionmental damage , amongst othe things , of having to educe banana poduction in Madeia dastically , as a esult of complete libealization of tade in this poduct , is inc@@ al@@ cul@@ able .
this epot analyses what went wong and poposes challenges that have yet to be ovecome , such as bette lin@@ k@@ up between teaching , pofessional taining and lifelong leaning systems .
we all agee that Euopean stuctual suppot cannot be spead even@@ ly acoss all the egions of Euope .
I do not know a single Euopean Head of State o Govenment who would be willing to discuss this fo even a minute .
the fact is that this is whee the end does not justify the means , and that is what must come between us and the appoach adopted by the Bush administation and the CIA .
the fist matte concens ou policy of coopeation with Tukey in elation to Ian .
I emind you that , in paallel with the Lisbon stategy , the Bolog@@ na pocess on the establishment of a common education space by 2010 should also be implemented as soon as possible .
amendment No 6 is poblematic because , as I have said , the study is just one of numeous documents which we may need to take into account in a poposal fo a new egulation .
fo example , when undetaking the essential efoms of financial sevices , we must emembe that innovative businesses and those employes need access to capital in global makets .
the vote on this impotant dossie will take place on Thusday at 11.30 a.m.
Paliament came up with a numbe of suggestions and poposals on this matte , wheeas thee was no such poposal fothcoming fom the Council and Commission which would have helped each ageement .
it would , theefoe , be a seious mistake if we wee to evese this decision of 1995 , in the pesent time .
if the Membe States fail to atify the Constitutional Teaty , we may have to accept that futue enlagement may also come to a halt .
thee is one thing I have to say about the fam budget .
I wonde who would guaantee that this data was potected fom abuse and abitay actions on the pat of states to the same extent as has hitheto been the case .
we obviously cannot succeed in this alone , but the Euopean Union &apos;s ole may be highly significant .
measues to egulate the makets that will enable us to avoid situations of pice o maket volatility o to intevene in such situations will be the focus of ou concens and of the poposals that the Commission will make as pat of the CAP post @-@ 2013 .
the Commission faces the task of assessing the main themes of this policy , and the altenatives to it that have emeged though a numbe of the answes we have eceived , including those that wee ecently incopoated into Paliament &apos;s own @-@ initiative epot .
all the people who featue in today &apos;s head@@ lines ae flooding into San@@ g@@ at@@ te .
amendment 9 speaks of &quot; intecultual civili@@ ty , &quot; but that is a contadiction in tems , othewise civili@@ ty no longe means anything !
situated in the middle of the Indian Oc@@ ean , in an aea whee stocks ae not ove @-@ exploited , an abund@@ ant souce of tuna and s@@ wo@@ d@@ fish is to be found , accessible by the local long line fishing method , ta@@ dable on the intenational maket , and impotant , if not vital , in tems of jobs in an aea which has been seiously hit by unemployment .
and lastly , in maitime tanspot it is essential , in ode to maintain pope levels of infastuctue and taining , that we should indeed have vey stict ules on this fo Euopean cews too , but especially shote sa@@ iling times oveall , not woking hous , not wok and est peiods , but simply a eduction in the length of time that ships ae unde way .
I am concened vey deeply about the isk that such additives and fla@@ vou@@ ings have on health and also the impact on childen , with some E numbes damaging to thei intelligence , and they can also cause alle@@ gies and othe diseases .
the Commission will closely follow the issue of the extenal debt of developing counties , in paticula the least @-@ developed ones .
amendment No 2 is theefoe intended to take account of these diffeent ules , which aleady impose highe standads , by making diffeent appoaches to it possible , without , though , undemining the diective &apos;s basic tendency .
if you have ideas , please help me out and pass them on to me .
Ukaine would , quite natually , clealy much athe buy the gas fom Russia and then sell it on to us , natually fo an additional chage , as would Tukey in elation to Nabucco , but I will etun to that late .
on behalf of the ALDE Goup . - ( SV ) M Pesident , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , M. Lyon has made a few , pehaps small , but nevetheless extemely impotant steps towads amending agicultual policy .
and the Euopean Union has the moal and political obligation to povide the financial esouces necessay to achieve fee education fo all between now and 2015 .
( Paliament adopted the esolution )
18 . 2@@ 4@@ th Annual Repot fom the Commission on monitoing the application of Community law (
it would be useful if we took stock afte the collapse of Communism and viewed the condition of the wold with geate sensitivity to the inte@@ dependence of global actos .
we have all woked long and had ove the past seveal days and these effots will continue until we have found a solution .
you should ead the book by Richad Flo@@ i@@ da in which he eflects on this situation .
we welcome the Pesidency &apos;s inteest , but we ae calling fo a single , cohesive and conc@@ ise famewok which will ally public opinion and policy @-@ makes aound common aspiations .
we all have a esponsibility .
we ae , of couse , in favou of espect fo the democatic Constitution , but we know that with egad to the issues concening Venezuela cuently being discussed , this is an agument that Pesident Cha@@ vez has used impo@@ p@@ ely to block o to attempt to block the couse of democacy in his county .
we need to find a solution which satis@@ fies ou expectations but also takes into account the specific situation of India .
it is now clea what a huge mistake it was to leave health sevices out of the Sevices Diective .
( u@@ po@@ a )
non @-@ govenmental oganisations wok on the basis of estimates accoding which 20 000 people ae waiting in Moocco .
the othe thing that we have in common is that it is the wokes , e@@ tied people and pensiones who ae paying fo this cisis , along with a geneation of wokes in unstable jobs who do not have any guaantees in the society in which they live .
that is enomously impotant fo the cedibility of what we do in that aea and fo ou legitimacy with ou citizens in what we do in that aea .
I am simply offeing a political judgement of no geat no@@ vel@@ ty o sa@@ g@@ acity .
we can no longe allow these companies to act with impunity and we now need to define a clea opeating famewok fo these companies at Euopean and global level .
yet the opposite is the case ; the tansitional ules do not keep migant wokes out .
in the face of the challenges and social consequences w@@ ought by the &apos; infomation society &apos; it would be a good thing if the Euopean Union wee to plan ahead in ode to set up a joint legislative famewok suitable fo egulating some of these consequences aleady mentioned : tele@@ wok , pivacy , linguistic diffeences , the effect on health , on schools , on teaching , the potection needed fo uses as such and as consumes , etc .
to my mind , in the last two yeas this pize has been awaded to candidates who wee not the best .
simply , by way of a pa@@ enth@@ es@@ is , I would like to emind you that the Euopean Paliament has neve fomulated pecise poposals with egad to the composition of the Commission , no with egad to the weigh@@ ting of votes within the Council .
I would be inteested to know whethe the Commission and the Council ae awae of the need fo sufficiently pecise and fai pio negotiation , and also of the extent to which national paliaments ae consulted on conventions of this kind .
I believe that the elationship of goodwill , tust and undestanding built up ove the last decade between the Euopean Ombudsman and EU institutions constitutes a pecious esouce fo impoving the quality of public administation in Euope to the benefit of citizens .
the Belgian wok pogamme is ambitious , and it is also set against an extaodinay context in ode to egain the tust of the citizens , in othe wods , with the intoduction of the euo , a debate on the futue of Euope and also a debate on enlagement .
in view of the expeiences in the cuent session , this House must make a citical eview of the weeks in Stasboug , which must , among othe things , conside the additional costs involved with no additional esults in etun .
M Pesident , the Democatic Republic of Congo is neithe democatic no a e@@ public .
this would be the best way to pull this poject out of the ut it is cuently stuck in and make eal pogess .
lastly , I wish to thank Paliament fo its suppot .
we need to povide economic impetus and be competitive - something that the Commissione was also saying - because this aea poduces moe than 50 % of Spanish expots .
fifthly , and this aspect is especially impotant in this case , the Commission has taken measues to eliminate the element of state aid involved in Iish copo@@ ation tax .
we must be quite clea about the fact that we do not want clon@@ ed meat to be appoved in Euope , fo both animal welfae and ethical easons .
we will have to keep tack of the issue of minoities .
take a scientific , evidence @-@ based appoach and e @-@ examine this poposal athe than - with espect - just dance , albeit be@@ late@@ dly , to the tune of the Intenational Council fo the Explo@@ ation of the Sea .
M Mas@@ to@@ akis has aleady quoted some Geek to you and I am going to quote some Latin : e@@ ae human@@ um est , peseve@@ ae au@@ tem di@@ abo@@ lic@@ um .
M Pesident , the justice system in Malaysia is clealy otten to the coe .
so , we welcome Paliament &apos;s poposals fo a new text on scu@@ b@@ bing .
it is the job of the Pesident of the sitting , and him alone , if he decides to do so at any time , to establish that a qu@@ oum is not pesent .
fom that pespective , it would be dangeous to ty and defend old stuctues and old playes .
that , because in the latte case the balance of the ecosystem could be affected , as also could competitiveness , ganted that fames depend on cetain companies which hold patents on the genetically modified plant but also on the in@@ sec@@ ti@@ cide to which it is esis@@ tant .
Madam Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , the fothcoming wold tade confeence in Singapoe must not become focused on implementation and eview - it must tackle the new aeas that we in this Euopean Paliament ightly fomulated immediately afte the Uuguay Round .
to succeed as the most pogessive combination of States , we must ensue that ou institutions ae fully democatic and accountable and that the individual and collective ights of all ae guaanteed and defended .
the new package of Commission initiatives in the field of the Euopean social model is a long ovedue and incomplete supplement to activities undetaken at national level in the stuggle to impove the standad of living of Euopean citizens , einfoce thei ights and combat discimination .
howeve , we all know that the content of these epots is not the main obstacle to the commen@@ cement of accession talks .
a date which many ae looking fowad to .

afte these multilateal &quot; acquis &apos; negotiations , which could take a yea , bilateal negotiations should be stated with those counties who ae eady , pobably the five plus one which the Commission has selected , but also othe states if they ae eady .
the aims of the poposed diective ae to guaantee the fee movement of chemical substances and pepaations and to impove health potection and consume safety by pohibiting the placing of C@@ M@@ R substances on the maket fo use by the geneal public .
the position on my side is clea and , as it is aleady late , I shall fo@@ eg@@ o the two minutes &apos; speaking time .
I also appeciate the EU initiative of the Action Plan fo Foest Law En@@ fo@@ cement , Govenance and Tade .
and fo the new Membe States I think it is paticulaly impotant that we have included the stengthening of the social dialogue and hence of the social patnes .
pioiti@@ sation within the themes and a high level of flexibility ae also necessay .
and now , M Pesident , I would like to begin my allotted intevention by pointing out that this esolution aims to tackle the poblem of the devas@@ tation caused by hu@@ i@@ can@@ e Mich@@ elle , which has paticulaly affected thee counties : Honduas , Nicaagua and Cuba .
this initiative is complementay to the ecently adopted fedeal law on the efom of the judiciay system and could be ep@@ li@@ cated by othe fedeal states .
inceasing awaeness and visibility of the pocess was one of the big challenges ageed by almost all paticipants in the pocess .
it is ou intention to hold a geen summit in ealy Novembe , at which ou poposals can be developed and foc@@ us@@ sed .
twenty ecent new cases in No@@ th@@ um@@ be@@ land that fo thee months had seen no new infec@@ tions .
I should like to emphasise that in a question I ecently addessed to the Commission , I aised a question concening the scope of the Stability and Gowth Pact , which may be exceeded in cetain exceptional cases , such as the implementation of public building and social housing pojects .
I believe we in Paliament agee that we do not suppot any eosion of the substance of established Community law and pactice - the acquis communautaie - as a consequence of simplification measues .
and the legacy of the wa is still appaent .
I myself had the oppotunity , duing the meeting of the Committee on Civil Libeties , Justice and Home Affais on 22 July , to explain the wok@@ ings of the T@@ F@@ TP and why we need an inteim solution to pevent its inteup@@ tion .
on behalf of the majoity of Can@@ adi@@ ans who ae opposed to the hun@@ t , thank you fo the leadeship you ae taking on this issue .
the Euopean Paliament and the EU need to send a clea message to Pakistan and uge the Pakistani Govenment to do its best to avoid this kind of situation .
on 14 Apil , Commissione Reding spoke hee .
it endoses the esumption of fee tade ageement negotiations with Cental Ameica , Colombia and Peu .
the Essen Summit laid the basis fo a confeence which bought togethe the eal paties who must coopeate if the fight against faud is going to be successful .
M Pesident , this vote maks the end of a debate which was unde discussion fo thee legisla@@ tues .
geneally , I am not in favou of fist @-@ eading ageements , believing that they ae best avoided if at all possible .
I am , of couse , pleased that the fishing ageement between the EC and the Seych@@ elles , the fist ageement negotiated within the famewok of the Patneship Ageements , has been extended .
&apos;@@ the cleaing up of an offence is almost delibeately delayed &apos; , and we might wonde whethe the Un@@ it fo the Co@@ odin@@ ation of Fau@@ d Pe@@ vention ( UCLAF ) is &apos; actually being used to cove up the tuth &apos; .
that change is lagely due to this House and this epot has played a useful pat in this pocess .
it is a basic tool fo the pivatisation and commeci@@ alisation of education and eseach and aims to ceate two @-@ speed institutions , with centes of &apos; excellent &apos; and second @-@ class institutions .
we also know that , in the view of the Commissione heself , this is an outdated system that must be bought to an end .
the fact that this epot and its pedecesso have taken so long to poduce suely demonstates that the Euopean Paliament is not a foum fo the pomotion of libeal dugs policies .
I would also like to mention ou Amendment No 13 in which we addess a geneal aising of the etiement age as a way of solving futue pension poblems .
the next stage will be amendment of oigin potocols in the cuent bilateal association ageements in ode to in@@ set the changes necessay fo the application of di@@ ag@@ onal acc@@ um@@ ulation .
it is only whee we ae looking at sevices which come within the boadcasting emit that we say that they should be within the scope of the diective , although in the case of vide@@ o on demand we ae ada@@ man@@ t that these should not be subject to the quota egime .
I would add that un@@ announced visits to detention centes ae aimed at peventing ill @-@ teatment , which geneally goes un@@ punished in Fance , as indicated in the most ecent epot by the Committee fo the Pe@@ vention of To@@ tue .
M Pesident , on behalf of the Socialist Goup , I would just like to suppot you poposal - although it has no statutoy value - and to wish ou colleague , M Ga@@ zi@@ ani , all the best fo a swift ecovey so that he might pesent his epot at the Septembe pat @-@ session .
to put it in anothe way , the Euopean Paliament does not wish to be pat of the poblem , it wishes to be pat of the solution .
simila situations aose in the westen pat of Fance , whee many oads wee im@@ p@@ ass@@ able to taffic and caused gi@@ d@@ lock to the tanspot system .
howeve , we ae seeing that , unde the potection of this exemption , and in ode to bing in Asian investos , Papua New Guinea has amended its legislation so that it is not possible to make complaints about envionmental damage , and has implemented investment ules that allow local wokes and cheap labou fom Asia to be h@@ ied , along with the wost imagin@@ able labou standads .
the thid objective is to make cohesion policy moe geneous .
I think that we will need to be vey pudent in the management of some dossies .
the same should happen now .
I am pleased to hea that yesteday the Committee on Extenal Economic Relations adopted an opinion which clealy ecommends the appoval of this ageement .
I would like the Commissione to investigate the situation , because to all appe@@ aan@@ ces , neithe the national egul@@ ato no the govenment seems able to do so .
thank you vey much , M Flynn .
so thee is a poblem .
I believe that it is impotant fom Paliament &apos;s point of view fo us to estate the impotance of potecting intellectual popety , to estate potection fo pivate life , to estate even the ight people have to pivacy , a ight which at the moment is being violated by majo telecommunications companies .
ou key objective should not be to advocate biodivesity as an end in itself , but to potect a development model that enables people to enjoy the highest possible quality of life , which is only possible if &quot; natual &quot; space is peseved and maintained .
we welcome the initiative in the epot to the effect that monetay policy should also be linked to the level of unemployment and not only to pice stability .
constant effots to define the obvious lead to distotions of popotion .
M Pesident , fistly I wish to thank Ms Miguélez Ramos fo all the wok she has done in pepaing this own @-@ initiative epot .

in addition , this poposal intoduces a system of emegency payments and extends the possibilities of legal ecouse .
on the contay , I believe that coopeation between police foces and the investigating authoities in Membe States equies , in cetain cases , the suppot of public opinion .
the tend cetainly places highe demands on doctos , but a docto will achieve the best elationship with a patient who is well infomed .
( applause )
we must avoid intoducing amendments with legal loopholes , unnecessaily esticting the scope of the diective .
I am extemely pleased that the Euopean Union ceated the Solidaity Fund a few yeas ago , and is using it .
what is new about the peace facility is that we ae ceating a basis fo spending money on things we wee neve able to spend money on befoe .
the othe poblem they ae facing is the question of intoducing a fee maket , in paticula in electicity .
it emains to be seen whethe this will be possible as egads tade .
( applause )
does the Euopean Paliament have a full ole in making this codecision and is this also to be an issue this week in the context of the widening of the safety net ?
it succeeded the Sante Commission , which had to go pecisely because nobody took esponsibility .
the agenda will focus on two subjects : enlagement and the functioning of the Council in the light of enlagement .
M Pesident , a Fench politician - now somewhat fogotten , although undes@@ eve@@ dly so , because his healthy cyni@@ cism was so ef@@ es@@ hing , Pesident Hen@@ i Qu@@ eu@@ ille - once said that politics is not about solving poblems , but keeping those who aise poblems quiet .
we have to face up to the fact that , as soon as the toops wee withdawn , thee was scacely any inteest in Somalia any moe .
this opens a vei@@ table Pan@@ doa &apos;s box against libety and pomotes the emoval of functions fom the Membe States , such as the decision ove tans@@ fe@@ al of data about thei citizens , which is being given to a Euopean &apos; judicial public authoity &apos; .
to wind up the debate , six motions fo esolution ( 1 ) have been tabled unde Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Pocedue .
I should like nonetheless to put fowad a citicism concened with an aspect that , unfotunately , has not been taken into account .
the Euopean Paliament intends to guaantee these funds even afte 2013 because bee@@ keeping is one of the activities fully compatible with the sustainability and divesification objectives that the new CAP aims to achieve .
one of the pimay objectives of the new e@@ unified Euope , with its 25 Membe States , will have to be the achievement of a pefeential elationship with these neighbouing counties of both Easten Euope , Russia and Asia , such as Kazakhstan , and those which make up the Middle East egion and lie on the Mediteanean Bas@@ in .
thee is a shot phase in one paagaph to the effect that a futue evision of the Teaty should povide fo geate involvement of the Community in mattes elating to health potection .
the Euopean banking fede@@ ations must submit a complete oveview to the Commission by 31 Mach at the latest , and at that time the Commission will undetake a full evaluation of the situation .
as fa as the Committee on Agicultue is concened , two points stood out in paticula , and it will not supise you to lean that the essential one , to which pevious speakes have aleady efeed , was that the Committee on Agicultue is also , of couse , in favou of clean wate .
afte all , unde intenational law , the settlements do not belong to the state of Isael .
Col@@ a@@ j@@ anni epot
the Council and the Commission failed to undestand that Paliament was poposing a new way of legisl@@ ating in the Euope of 27 , with diffeent egulatoy developments and expeiences , and diffeent bueaucatic systems .
this has esulted in po@@ pon@@ ents and opponents alike paying inadequate attention to the pactical consequences of abolition .
it should have been settled a long time ago .
it was with sa@@ dness and indignation that I eceived the news of the mude of the Russian jounalist Anna Polit@@ kov@@ s@@ ka@@ ya .
on the thee issues aised - which I hope will be appoved in the esolution - which my goup advocates , I believe that the Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has been vey clea and explicit in elation to pimay law , with the eimbusement of expenditue and with taxation .
this is twice as many as in the USA , but with half the amount of ai taffic .
howeve , we believe that a communication on pomising an effective solution - it could have a happ@@ ie title - to the ni@@ tates poblem suggested by the epot might povide a futhe excuse fo delay in implementation .
the Commission should be decentalised , so that the staff ae given esponsibility and authoity to live up to .
this calls fo geate dynamism and a moe significant ole fo the Euopean institutions , including this Paliament and all those listening today .
on behalf of the Goup of the Euopean People &apos;s Paty ( Chistian Democats ) and Euopean Democats , I denounce this esumption of teo .
the Stockholm Summit led to a geneal incease in awaeness about the majo theats to ou envionment .
the Russian Fedeation , as has been said seveal times , is a wold powe , one of the key playes in the intenational scene , as M Mil@@ l@@ án M@@ on said , and it is moeove ou neighbou .
may I ask you theefoe to wite on behalf of the Euopean Paliament to all those involved and congatulate them on this majo initiative ?
on the basis of the tol@@ ls that Austia colle@@ cts , it would take 300 yeas fo Austia to be able to fund its shae of the Benne tunnel .
if thee is one lesson we can and must lean fom this cisis , it is that thee can be no effective potection of human health o development of lasting agicultue without pemanent eseach into the hamonious integation of agicultual activity and natue .
( FR ) M Pesident , the I@@ anians stated that they wee eady fo a gadual exchange of low @-@ enich@@ ed uanium fo fuel .
M Pesident , Madam Pesident , Commissione , honouable Membes , the egions affected by povety and inadequate development ae looking to the guidelines we ae poposing in the hope that they will contibute effectively to thei development .
( it ) M Pesident , I am speaking unde Rule 17@@ 3 of the Rules of Pocedue .
plant health ules and contols ae applied to vaying degees , ceating entiely unfai situations .
but if we take a close look at what the Euopean Union as a whole has done to combat tafficking in human beings , then I fo one see vey little .
but I will say moe about that duing the next debate .
fom 1 Januay 2009 the euo will link the people of Slovakia to the Union evey day .
the futhe development of qualitative and quantitative me@@ tics should be based on the Euopean Qu@@ ality of Life Su@@ vey ( E@@ Q@@ L@@ S ) indicatos , coveing the coe aeas of quality of life .
what should the dive &apos;s intelligence involve ?
ou esolution ightly calls fo a package of measues to tackle this situation .
this sevice can suvive by public funding that may be collected via a sepaate adio and television tax and that may be top@@ ped up with membeship contibutions to boadcasting oganisations , as has been the case in the Nethelands fo a long time .
but if no had scientific evidence can be poduced , then obviously no impot ban can be imposed .
the poposal sends out a stong signal to the makets .
it is stated that Bitain has not opted into this aea of Community law and the in@@ feence is that it will not affect us - but is that tue ?
in conclusion , I should also like to thank anothe Euopean Union institution , namely the Cout of Auditos , fo its contibution to the wok on the ules fo paticipation in esponding to ou invitation to give an opinion .
in Fance , fo example , some public sevices wish to intoduce a educed VAT system pomoting the &apos; multi @-@ mateial &apos; appoach in ode to pomote the E@@ co @-@ em@@ bal@@ la@@ ges company , and yet this is to the detiment of othe eco @-@ tax collecting companies .
M Pesident , let me say to the honouable Membe that the accession talks poceed fom the pinciple that the candidate counties ecognise the so @-@ called acquis communautaie , the established body of Community law and pactice , which is non @-@ negoti@@ able , and that they will apply it fom the moment of thei accession .
in view of the lage numbe of vei@@ fications to be caied out and the constaints on time , it was consideed appopiate fo the Committee on Legal Affais , and theefoe its Chaiman , to pesent an oal epot to Paliament .
( DE ) M Pesident , Commissione , the eason why I have asked to speak is that I expect you , Commissione , to be able to set out fo us a pope tack ecod at the end of this paliamentay tem .
but it is afte all govenments which ae in chage of the Commission and not the Commission which is in chage of govenments .
in the field of teoism , we have aleady adopted 58 egulations , diectives and so on - 27 of them ae in the daft stage and some 15 ae yet to come .
feedom of eligion geneally , of which we have aleady spoken today , is one of the aeas in which futhe pogess must be made as a matte of ugency and whee concete measues must now be taken .
. - M Pesident , without doubt , the debate on the Community patent is of no small significance in tems of the Euopean economy .
although you stessed the impotance of Euopol , what that means in plain language is that Euopol must be given not only moe staff but also moe powes , o else the whole thing will not be wokable .
this ce@@ do will do a lot of ham to the Euopean Union , paticula as egads egulatoy and economic policy .
( PL ) Madam Pesident , I endosed the inteesting epot on the cultual dimensions of the EU &apos;s extenal actions .
inceased poduction costs and the distibution of income thoughout the value chain becomes even moe un@@ favouable to the poduce with the inclusion of yet anothe business agen@@ t in that chain .
that is how we mobilise additional money .
the fee movement of sevices is in all ou inteests .
at that meeting , Commissione Oeja announced that he would be paticipating in the Wold Confeence on doping to be held in L@@ aus@@ an@@ ne .
I believe it is impotant fom time to time to allow cultue to highlight society &apos;s citicisms and it is something we could lean fom hee in Paliament .
Ms Pol@@ i Bot@@ one has listed all the things we have achieved .
in witing . - The Pittella epot , which I suppoted , highlights the impotance of cultue , habits and languages in consume choices and potection fo financial poducts .
nevetheless , I think that what is impotant is fo the elationship to continue to be pomoted and stengthened afte that Pesidency has ended .
I voted in favou of Amendment 2 initiated by the Goup of the Euopean People &apos;s Paty ( Chistian Democats ) because a lage numbe of poduces have aleady stated to invest with a view to modenising thei ea@@ ing systems o ae at the point of launching such investments .
it is absolutely essential to encouage and develop eseach in this aea , paticulaly in connection with pevention , diagnosis and teatment , when the fundamental pinciple is that the public secto takes on these esponsibilities without estictions of benefit o access fo any patient .
with egad to financial pespectives and the cohesion policy and the outemost egions , we cetainly welcome the UK Pesidency &apos;s stated aim of eaching a consensus on the package of egulations as soon as possible so that it can be finalised vey quickly once the outcome of the futue financing negotiations is known .
we acknowledge , secondly , that geate quality , ceti@@ fications , audits and so on will entail additional costs fo ou fames , paticulaly the smalle ones .
as I see it , that alone is a good enough eason fo investigating whethe this decision is at all sustainable in legal tems .
the next item is the joint debate on :
fuel oil is still was@@ hing up on the coasts of Galicia and in the Bay of Bis@@ cay ; a week ago I saw this situation fo myself , in the Ros@@ to s@@ and@@ banks at C@@ ape Fin@@ is@@ tee .
the povision of such data acoss the Community will allow the impact and benefits of possible measues to be popely assessed pio to pesenting Community legislative poposals .
finally , I am aising these points because ou election cycles and the cycle of challenges we face ae out of syn@@ c : we deal well with the poblems that fit into fou@@ - o five @-@ yea cycles .
as the Council has decided to extend the pogamme &apos;s duation to seven yeas athe than the five poposed by the Commission , the clause intoduced by Paliament will allow the pogamme to adapt flexi@@ bly to any new equiements .
just a wod , M Pesident , about Amendment No 19 . this is a vey impotant amendment which simply equests that the Committee of Expe@@ ts , of which we quite ightly have such a high opinion , should conside Paliament &apos;s administative and financial opeation .
Madam Pesident , we voted fo the epot because the integation of the two diectives on incine@@ ating hazadous and non @-@ hazadous waste is to be welcomed .
at all times the Commission has made it clea to all concened that it expects the Fench govenment to honou any legal obligation it may have to compensate those oad hau@@ lies who ae diectly and advesely affected by the dispute last yea egadless of thei nationality .
I think it is cucial that the competent authoities in the diffeent Membe States do actually make use of the flexibility that is aleady povided fo in the pesent Regulation , and exempt cetain food companies fom what is afte all a vey complicated H@@ AC@@ C@@ P pocedue , on condition , of couse , that the same standads of hygiene safety can be demonstated and guaanteed .
the Membe States should theefoe pass legislation to potect them fom violence and give bette suppot to victims .
the defects of the Stability and Gowth Pact , in both its substance and its enfocement , have been obvious fo some time ; it is ight that effots ae now undeway to ensue a lasting settlement that woks .
when you get a chance to speak to such an agee@@ able gatheing , you can feel like saying a bit too much , but I would like to say in conclusion that ou citizens expect the Euopean Union to delive secuity , moe effective decision @-@ making and the ability to espond to new challenges as a matte of couse .
that is a vey pessing timetable if we want the Euopean Paliament to be able to fully play its pat . the timing will be vey tight anyway , beaing in mind that we have elections in June .
it is easy to talk about heo@@ ism , but genuinely dealing with the consequences is anothe and much sa@@ dde stoy .
we have launched a common enegy stategy in Euope , something that was unthinkable two yeas ago .
Euopean tanspot companies , whethe they opeate tains , oad vehicles , aicaft o ships , ae the most moden in the wold .

I believe that the Commission and , with it , the entie Euopean Union has made it clea , fom the stat , that we condemn any sot of ethnic violence , egadless of who is infli@@ cting and who is suffeing it .
inceased competitiveness in industy and impoved poductivity cannot eally happen at the expense of cu@@ tbacks and flexibility in the labou makets .
to my mind , the EU embago will not do vey much .
as you know , the code of conduct is cuently being evised ; it will cove vitually all activities closely o emo@@ tely connected with ams tansfes .
given the vey apid pace of technological and scientific pogess in medicine , lifelong leaning in one &apos; s chosen pofession is paticulaly impotant .
a coheent stategy to combat climate change is theefoe desiable .
it seems that the integation of economic and social policy is moe obvious than integating envionmental policy into economic policy .
the highlighted shotcomings have lagely been familia to us fo a long time .
this is why we vey much need the new contol measues intoduced by the egulation which has been adopted .
thank you , Madam Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office , fo that vey full and infom@@ ative statement . I shall now give the floo without futhe delay to M van den Boek , on behalf of the Commission .
these pactices ae epe@@ hen@@ sible ; they may be cultual , pehaps ti@@ bal , but they ae ciminal and ae not in any way eligious .
the ecognition by Ma@@ o &apos;s successo D@@ en@@ g X@@ i@@ ao P@@ ing and his succ@@ essos of some capitalist and fee maket ealities has enabled China to pogess economically to the point it has eached today .
go on José Sa@@ aman@@ go Foundation !
following on fom the Euopean Council of 21 Novembe , the Council , as ageed , set aside ECU 150 million in commitments fo the employment initiative pomoted by the Euopean Paliament .
I suppot the g@@ ist of the Commission &apos;s poposal in which it wishes to put a check on the fast gowing shae of aviation in climate change .
fo that eason , I think it makes sense that we should act not meely as the accounts cle@@ k checking the balance sheet of the Euopean secuity and defence policy &apos;s pogess , but in a much moe fundamental capacity .
I can povide confimation fom acoss the goup divide that those W@@ af@@ es ae indeed vey good .
Kozlo@@ du@@ y has demonstated to me how little the Commission knows about what is happening with ou money . it also demonstated that the numeous subsidiay budgets which have come into existence make it moe difficult to contol the situation and also esult in the Commission losing its oveview .
the Fe@@ et T@@ ust told me , vey tem@@ pe@@ ately , that they thought the detemination of whethe fee@@ ts should be included in the pet passpot scheme should be de@@ feed until futhe eseach had been caied out and they quote two US authoities , D Bu@@ ce W@@ illi@@ ams and D Z@@ ack Mille , as expets in that field .
fo these easons , we voted against the adoption of the joint text .
what happens late should be completely tanspaent .
it did so by educing pensions by 10 % and the pensions of woking pensiones by 70 % , educing family benefits and matenity benefits fo woking paents by 10 % , as well as educing non @-@ tax@@ able pesonal income tax thesholds .
. the Euopean Union pointed out that the ele@@ ases of political pisones mentioned by the honouable Membe wee a welcome step towads national econciliation in Buma .
M Pesident , I should like to thank Commissione Bangemann fo his eve @-@ positive and involved pesence amongst us .
Re@@ feing to you question , si , I am not eally sue that I undestood it .
Hungay &apos;s fist ailway line peceded the Fench bou@@ geo@@ is evolution of 18@@ 48 by two yeas , and moe o less the same people wee behind both events .
it is esticted to civil and administative emedies .
since thee is a significant numbe of nuclea stations in Euope , and since these stations ae often close to bodes , a coss @-@ bode appoach must be adopted to nuclea safety , coodinated at the EU level .
a consideable numbe of amendments poposed by ou goup , including the 11 amendments I suggested as shadow appoteu , have been adopted by the Committee on Foeign Affais .
a stuctual appoach is necessay .
the genetic esouces of ou planet must not be mono@@ poli@@ zed in the pivate hands of a few companies .
theefoe , this decision could set a pecedent .
the state of emegency pevailing in this county , which has taditionally been secula , pogessive and democatic , must be immediately lifted to allow the Tunisian authoities to esume nomal democatic pocesses .
as will be seen fom the epot , the global objectives have not been uni@@ fom@@ ly achieved by all counties .
at the same time , it is impotant fo the EU to paticipate in an intenational context .

let me finish with a plea to each and evey one of you .
competitive neutality is a must , but it is infin@@ ged by what you ae hoping to adopt .
we and the est of the wold have signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Chi@@ ld .
thee is now wide ageement about the desi@@ ability of IS@@ AF boaden@@ ing its mandate beyond Kabul .
does the EU have plans to compensate those counties fo losses of consevation evenues fom an ongoing ban on the sale of ele@@ ph@@ ant poducts ?
. my main consideation in passing judgement on the Podi Commission is whethe this team of 20 has convinced me of its ability to significantly estoe public confidence in the Euopean Union and its institutions .
could we pehaps continue to ci@@ b fom him just a little ?
things being what they ae , I obviously undestand why the Socialist Goup in the Euopean Paliament is poposing this postponement : the Socialists ae in favou of inceasing the minimum ates of excise duty , while in Bulgaia , they ae against doing so .
the UN estimates that moe than 200@@ .000 people ae without oo@@ fs ove thei heads , and many of them ae in dange of dying of cold now .
the H@@ é@@ be@@ ti@@ stes wee xen@@ opho@@ bes duing the Fench Revolution ; Blan@@ qu@@ i was a xen@@ opho@@ be .
we went to Ms H@@ and@@ z@@ li@@ k &apos;s home town and we met the businesses in he Chambe of Comm@@ ece .
the Commission communication , &quot; A new patneship with South @-@ East Asia , &quot; stipulates that all new bilateal acco@@ ds concluded with counties in that egion must include the &quot; essential element &quot; clause on human ights .
this is a tiny little symbolic step , but believe me , it is a vey impotant one fo us , the new Membe States .
the special Council meeting has now decided on thee additional safety measues . fistly , this ban must be made clea , and it must be made clea once and fo all that feeding animal meal to he@@ bi@@ vo@@ es emains pohibited .
M Pesident , the Cout of Justice has , in effect , just passed a uling which concens us diectly , stating that the Edinbugh decision should be intepeted as defining the seat of Paliament as the place whee twelve odinay pat @-@ sessions must be held egulaly .
I await with inteest the political impetus to come fom the Euopean Council towads a Euopean chate fo sustainable development , which the Commission will cetainly follow up and suppot .
does the Commission intend to negotiate the eimbusement of the above illegal aids in ode to pevent the beak @-@ up and closue of the Spanish shipyads ?
M Pesident , in Monday &apos;s debate on the foest fies duing the summe of 2009 , I said that natual conditions will alte with climate change .
I should theefoe biefly like to comment , if I may , on a numbe of pecautionay steps that we might conside taking with egad to Ian .
howeve , I am convinced that the Commission poposal fo opt @-@ in is best , fo essentially two easons .
with enough money and the ight connections , anything may be puch@@ ased , fom a hand gun to a je@@ t figh@@ te plane .
howeve , I think that we must attach moe impotance to the situation in the Republic of Moldova fom whee we ae getting woying signals about the feedom of expession and the integity of the elections which ae due to take place this sping .
I would like to thank M Cap@@ uch@@ o fo his wok thoughout his vice @-@ pesidency .
it seems as if the Bitish Govenment does not take it seiously and subsidiaity has not woked in this case .
maketing and advetising ae an impotant pat of communications , and if manufactues &apos; poducts ae to compete on the maket , advetising must obviously use means that catch people &apos;s attention .
( NL ) M Pesident , many Membes hee ae taking a hypocitical appoach in thei statements on the budget .
we continue to be al@@ amed about the human ights situation in Si Lanka , against the backgound of epots of exta@@ judicial killings , abduc@@ tions and seious intimidation of the media .
I also vey much hope that the summit in Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ a@@ j@@ aa will be able to see a futhe development in ou elations with the two egions with which we have only ecently negotiated sensible ageements .
in othe wods , a full one and a half hous should be set aside fo question time , fo the ight to ask questions is a fundamental ight of evey paliamen@@ taian .
last and not least is the question of successful implementation of the Commission efoms .
consequently , we cannot focus ou effots just on the deadlock of Russia &apos;s economy whee , as M Heman vey ightly said , the battle has aleady been lost and it will take a vey long time fo the economy to ecove .
you see the high emphasis that the S@@ L@@ O@@ RC egime places on intenational investment thee .
most ecently it was discussed by the ciminal case coopeation team in Octobe , just a week ago .
we need someone to guad those people fom thei own stupi@@ dity and eos .
this epot coves nealy evey aspect of policy .
divegen@@ t investigation standads must become a thing of the past , and at the end of the day we must have an instument - an instument with tee@@ th - to popely implement and enfoce the black@@ listing ules fo aicaft based outside as well as inside the Euopean Economic Aea .
the vey opposite is tue .
it is moe than a shame that the ageement with Jodan , fo example , has still not been atified by all the Membe States and we need to encouage people to get on with the atification of these ageements athe moe apidly .
it will be a sla@@ p in the face fo them if you wee to egad them as &apos; ove @-@ compensated &apos; .
in the case of intenational adop@@ tions , childen who ae taken away fom the envionment that they ae used to often suffe a huge amount of damage as a esult .
thee ae cuently two appoaches to the issue of EU finances .
if the legislation is insufficient , the Commission will have to put fowad a new poposal , and we will give it ou total suppot , and , in the meantime , I believe that the attitude shown by the Spanish Govenment - to immediately seek investos to esolve the poblem , which has aleady had a esult - shows that the Govenment &apos;s will is pecisely in tune with social concens and that it wishes to pevent the closue of this factoy .
moeove , it would make no diffeence as egads the possibilities of imposing penalties fo offences such as incoect o faudulent inspection .
en oute , the gils wee da@@ gged into a back alley and , allegedly , Son@@ ia was ap@@ ed by two of the thee men .
Euopean Con@@ sensu@@ s on humanitaian aid ( shot pesentation )
show that Euope can indeed move on fom statements to actions .
the EGF is not a eplacement fo actions that ae the esponsibility of fims unde national legislation o collective ageements , no does it finance the estuctuing of fims o sectos .
finally , I would like to thank M Cec@@ as and M Silva P@@ ene@@ da , who have tied to incopoate espect fo the pinciple of subsidiaity into this document .
this then esults in a gowing numbe of isks that may potentially ham not just supplie and consume goups but also the economies of entie nations .
a epot about the stuggle against S@@ hell was found on the back seat .
( it ) Madam Pesident , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , the D@@ ess epot maks the beginning of a new phase in the common agicultual policy ( CAP ) efom pocess .
no , ladies and gentlemen , it was not a question of be@@ ating the ai .
this is happening on a county @-@ by @-@ county basis .
Noth Afica and the Middle East equie a joint appoach and we ae convinced that Russia can play a fundamental ole in this context .
the second philosophy , the so @-@ called philosophy of egulated makets , consideed that consume potection equied competition on a single , tanspaent maket between all bids and offes , so as to enable clients to know the pice and to benefit fom the best possible pice .
we also saw a numbe of poblems within the common foeign and secuity policy in connection , fo example , with the EU &apos;s police mission in Bosnia whee tendes , contacts etc wee concened . on this subject , we believe that the Commission should investigate whethe sepaate ules might not be needed to adapt ou measues within the common foeign and secuity policy .
at the same time , I think that the tue dimension of this Constitution is that we , although the fist step was taken at Maasticht , ae only now eally changing fom an economic community to a political union : the end of the pillas , the communi@@ ti@@ sation of the thid pilla as egads the aea of feedom and justice and a fa moe developed extenal policy , enabling Euope to speak with one voice in this globalised wold .
thee ae human beings who need ou suppot and ou potection , people who lose ogans o even thei lives as a esult of this pactice .
afte all , these events sha@@ ped the twen@@ tieth centuy as we know it .
we ae not i@@ vals to the Commission , but allies , and can succeed only in mutual patneship .
the need fo apid legislation in the aea of medical devices manufactued utili@@ zing poducts deived fom human tis@@ sues o cells is clea if we want to avoid the isk of misuse .
in this Paliament these events cannot be epeated .
this is still ongoing wok .
my fouth and last comment will be on the evision of the OLAF egulation .
finally , do I need to emind the House of the way in which the Commission swe@@ pt aside almost all Paliament &apos;s amendments to the postal sevices diective ?
this would also be totally in keeping with my epot on the authoisation of pesticides .
we need to tackle this at intenational level , both within and outside Euope .
ladies and gentlemen , what is it that Euope needs ?
in categoy 5 last yea , EUR 70 million was undes@@ p@@ ent .
howeve , we ecognise that thee is a Euope @-@ wide , indeed woldwide , poblem with ove@@ fishing and unsustainable fish stocks .
but the way in which this epot was eventually poduced eally was not ideal and the Committee on Fisheies must take cae that it does not deal too often with such impotant and weigh@@ ty mattes with a seies of compomises which then have to be us@@ hed though the vote fo lack of time .
we cannot envisage a competition policy which develops temen@@ do@@ us@@ ly in all kinds of sectos and then just do the wok with the same numbe of people .
the Pesident said this was unacceptable and invited M B@@ loo@@ m to apologise .
the solution , M Mandelson , is to in@@ vent a new customs technology .
I believe that to a lage extent this can be attibuted to an inadequate pesence of the Council of Ministes in the Middle East cisis , pehaps elated to the intenal poblems of the county execising the pesidency , while in fact Italy , owing to its position , its geogaphical position , and its histoical ties , could have played a vey impotant ole .
we know that only one in thee employees has access to taining .
ethical questions occupy an impotant place in the science / society action plan .
if the evision of the diective achie@@ ves its pupose , it should also ensue that competitiveness with othe means of tanspot is estoed and that modes that emit less CO2 ae used .
howeve , what use is this pogess if , at the same time , Membe States ae pemitted to invest ERDF funds in oad planning and c@@ olo@@ ss@@ al waste @-@ incineation plants , the use of which aggav@@ ates climate change an@@ e@@ w and ha@@ ms the envionment ?
it is this vey soft and fiendly fom of altenative assessment which supplements the isk assessment being dafted .
we will be discussing this with M Oettinge in futue .
that is why I suppot the suspension of this 80 / 20 ule .
M Pesident , natually , we also wish you all the best fo the New Yea .
this is an ab@@ omin@@ able decision that uns counte to the explicit esolutions of the UN , and - ove and above the escalation that is taking place - it is a decision that should be condemned by the civili@@ zed wold and , we hope , by this House also .
I would just like to comment on the ap@@ ple compaison .
this feedom does not actually exist .
moeove , it is some con@@ sol@@ ation to lean that only pat of these complaints wee consideed to come unde the emit of the Euopean Ombudsman , because a lage popotion of the complaints not taken up by the Euopean Ombudsman wee tansfeed to othe bodies , including the Committee on Petitions , which I chai .
so the Council is not willing to go futhe in its assessment than is the case today .
the Middle East is a subject on which one could speak fo hous , but I shall take up the most impotant points .
thus it must be clealy noted that the Teaty of Amstedam , which is going to be submitted to Membe States fo atification , takes pecisely the opposite path .
the Euopean Union cannot lose the oppotunity of obtaining a stategic patneship with Bazil .
the taget goup of the inceased potection is the insu@@ ed paties and not the shaeholdes , who ae not subject to individual supevision .
I can only say that I and my goup agee with this compomise , even if the newspapes and the Paliament &apos;s Minutes and pess ele@@ ases said I voted against it - I only voted against the numbe of points because I thought 6.@@ 9 million was athe too low .
the fundamental appoach to the poblem of AIDS is based on esolving this political and economic issue fo the benefit of the peoples .
is this the stat of EU hamonisation of tax policy acoss the Union - something they said would neve happen ?
the Stockholm Pogamme ( 2010 @-@ 2015 ) , when viewed fom the pespective of coopeation within the aea of feedom , secuity and justice ( A@@ F@@ S@@ J ) , in eality lays the futue foundations of Euopean sup@@ em@@ acy in many aeas with the aim of emoving any emaining obstacles to &apos; fee movement &apos; between the EU Membe States .
M Pesident , the histoic events of August 1980 stated the pocess which ended the cold wa and led to the eunification of Euope .
they ae seeking to legitim@@ ise the EU in multilateal oganisations - the Noth Atlantic Teaty Oganisation ( NATO ) , the Intenational Monetay Fund ( IMF ) , the Oganisation fo Secuity and Coopeation in Euope ( OSCE ) and the Wold Bank - and ae seeking to eplace states with egional integation oganisations , fo example , in the United Nations Geneal Assembly , whee each county and its people still have the same weight , iespective of thei size .
but ou satisfaction with this infomal aangement does not , egettably , extend to the moe fomal side of things .
these events cannot simply be put on one side .
the next item is the debate on the epot ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 60 / 2001 ) by M Fava , on behalf of the Committee on Foeign Affais , Human Rights , Common Secuity and Defence Policy , on the Commission communication on EU Ele@@ ction Assistance and Obsev@@ ation &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 19@@ 1 - C5 ­ 02@@ 59 / 2000 - 2000 / 2@@ 137 ( COS ) &#93; .
howeve , it is impotant that such tempoay potection , which applies fo two yeas at the most , should not constitute a theat to the ight to seek asylum .
this situation did not change on the following Monday , when sales began in many Euopean counties .
thee is an absence of this type of legislation in cetain counties within the EU .
in ecent times , the financial secto has distoted its objectives of financing the development of the economy and , with the excuse of nee@@ ding to cove isks , has inceased ates , immediately obtaining enomous pofits that seiously affect public finances and citizens .
it is easy to undestand why people assume that the EU should make vigoous effots to pomote feedom of movement , especially since visa policy is hamonised and falls completely within the Commission &apos;s aea of competence .
one single amendment is not acceptable , namely Amendment No 9 on the suspension of the Regulation which I mentioned a moment ago .
this is a policy to be pusued by the Euopean Union as a whole .
such aspects , elating to investigations and ciminal pocedue , ae in many cases codi@@ fied in detail at national level as pat of the Membe States &apos; legal codes o even thei constitutions so as to be able to detemine the ights and duties of the paties involved .
an even swe@@ ete deam would be a new union eplacing the old Euopean one .
howeve , thee is anothe debate which needs to be held .
what bo@@ thes me as a citizen is that , duing the entie electoal campaign , I was not able to post anything citical of the cuent pesident on my blo@@ g , the Euo@@ polis , while public access to my blo@@ g was inteupted altogethe .
we believe these settlement infastuctues should be consideed as a sevice of geneal inteest .
thee is no doubt that these agencies should help Euopeans to acquie skills that they will be able to use on a apidly changing and eve moe competitive labou maket .
the development of a plan fo a bio @-@ Euope - paall@@ el@@ ing the e @-@ Euope - fo activities of the Commission and Membe States to make the Union a competi@@ to fo the biotechnology industy is a wothy aim .
I feel it is impotant that we ae able to discuss these topics at the lage @-@ scale Roma confeence being oganised on 16 Septembe , and I hope that the question of social inclusion of the Roma will be put on the agenda of the Euopean Council both sepaately and as pat of the social agenda .
in this context , atistic education has become an impotant element in peseving identity and pomoting intecultual and inte @-@ eligious undestanding .
today , employment must have ou full attention and must be ou pioity .
ae they doing the ight thing ?
it is fotunate that the administative coopeation ageement between the Sec@@ e@@ taies @-@ Geneal of the Commission , Paliament and the Council , signed on 7 Decembe 2006 togethe with the ED@@ PS , was enewed fo a futhe peiod of 3 yeas with effect fom 16 Januay 2007 .
foeign and secuity policy is no longe - if it eve was - the sot of agenda which is simply decided in the chan@@ c@@ el@@ lei@@ es of Euopean capitals .
I stongly believe that effots to isol@@ ate Pesident Aafat will only ex@@ as@@ pe@@ ate tensions within the Palestinian leadeship .
at Euopean level , which is coveed by point 64 of ou esolution , it is cucial that Paliament finally esponds to the appeal fom eseaches .
what does the Commission intend to do thee@@ afte ?
dates fo next sittings : see Minutes
M Pesident , I wish to begin by congatulating Hel@@ ena Toes Maques on he excellent epot .
I would like to thank M H@@ aan@@ go@@ z@@ ó fo dawing these issues to ou attention .
I am a bit pu@@ zz@@ led by this , howeve , because you thank@@ ed the Itali@@ ans fo thei good wok but at the same time we undestand fom the pess that you have not been given any notes o any indication as to whee ageement was eached .
afte bloody was with moe than two million cas@@ ual@@ ties in the N@@ D@@ RC and hundeds of thousands in Rwanda and Buundi , the fighting continues .
poblems also aise with use infomation , and with the wide vaiety of national ules .
the global fall in demand has esulted in a total of 7@@ 44 edundancies , as has aleady been mentioned , and we ae vey pleased that 400 of the people affected will eceive suppot though the Euopean Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
the Commission believes that it has to take into account the evolution of administative stuctues in the counties concened .
it must be clea , howeve - and we have established this in the Committee on Budgets and ae also ecommending it to the plenay - that contibutions fo SIS II be placed in the eseve , so that we can have moe contol ove the use of these funds .
Congo is devastated , having become the victim of explo@@ ites fo whom the county &apos;s abund@@ ant natual esouces ae moe impotant than human lives .
it was bu@@ ied , in Chal@@ eo@@ i , whee , seveal months late , the bodies of young gils wee being ex@@ hum@@ ed , who had been totued and mudeed .
we should be honest about that .
appoval of the Minutes of the pevious sitting : see Minutes
I believe that this must involve an intelligent , geen pocess which will be given pioity at evey level - local , national and Euopean - and will help impove the welfae of all citizens so that the Euopean Union becomes a leading playe in an inceasingly globalised economy .
allow me to conclude with a few wods on consume potection as a whole . I have been in the Euopean Paliament fo 10 yeas , duing which most of my time has been taken up with envionmental policy and consume potection .
this is why we must continue ou effots to aise awaeness among the Belausian population at lage though suppot to civil society and facilitation of contacts between the people .
we want to avoid quot@@ ing pecen@@ tages that might lead to mis@@ intepetation .
to what means can we have ecouse to ensue fee and divese media without at the same time setting aside anothe cad@@ inal pinciple of a democatic society - that of the distibution of powe .
leaving Q@@ im@@ onda to its fate will have extemely seious consequences .
yet it stikes me , Commissione , that this is pecisely what the Commission is inceasingly becoming , and in an inceasing numbe of fields .
we ae asked to believe that what ou citizens eally want is an EU with a legal pesonality , a legally binding Chate of Fundamental Rights , the emoval of the pilla stuctue , an extension of majoity voting , an EU pesident and foeign ministe , common asylum and immigation policies and a Euopean public posecuto - in shot , that people want a fundamental change in the elationship between the Union and its people .
that concludes Question Time .
finally , I would also undeline the need fo both the Council and the Commission to beak the cuent deadlock in employment and social policy .
I wished to mention this specifically because it is one of the pemanent featues of the Euopean Council .
we felt that it was impotant to include them because that consolida@@ tes the povisions of the Teaty .
instead , inta @-@ state conflicts ae becoming eve moe common .
the 1 18@@ 1 edundancies at fou poduction sites of the entepise Du@@ ck@@ ma@@ sch@@ inen A@@ G in Ba@@ den W@@ ü@@ t@@ tem@@ beg ( manufactuing of pin@@ ting machiney secto ) fall exactly into this categoy and I theefoe suppoted the mobilisation of EUR 8 308 5@@ 55 to assist them .
it is vey impotant to establish a common immigation policy , while developing tade and economic elations between the Euopean Union and Taiwan .
thus we cannot meely say &apos; we intend to use the open method of coodination &apos; because it is an effective instument fo achieving EU objectives .
this collective activity , by means of the divesity of leaning couses and social o even vocational inse@@ tion that it might popose , should be likely to develop a bette awaeness of Euopean citizenship among the young people concened .
this needs to be done though coopeation between the Council and the Euopean Paliament .
in this egad , I should be glad to know whethe the Commission is pepaed to go beyond non @-@ binding declaations and statements , whethe it is pepaed to go a step futhe , to sign a binding ageement and make a woldwide ban on cloning .
we cannot condemn such conduct and say that they ae ight to close Guantánamo , on the one hand , and toleate simila conduct , which we pehaps believe does not constitute such a seious poblem , on the othe .
on the contay , the fact is that China &apos;s economic pogess is patly based upon its systematically denying its own wokes thei most basic ights .
I think that this issue of a legal basis needs to be esolved as it is delaying implementation of the plans , which is essential fo con@@ seving the esouce and egulating fishing .
fo the moment , howeve , we ae in the pocess of appoving the Minutes .
. M Pesident , the epot that we ae debating undelines the impotance and stength of this House .
the content of the infomation policy is outside ou juisdiction .
the Euopean Commission does not paticipate in the fomal pocedue fo selec@@ ting and appoin@@ ting membes of the Goven@@ ing Council of the Euopean Cental Bank , but it has been luck@@ y enough to wok with and know M B@@ ini S@@ ma@@ gh@@ i fo a long time in his ole as a highly qualified and vey expeienced econom@@ ist in the Ban@@ ca d &apos;@@ Itali@@ a and in his wok within the Italian administation and also within the context of his vey active paticipation in the Economic and Financial Committee , within which , until he was appointed as a membe of the Executive Boad and of the Goven@@ ing Council of the Euopean Cental Bank , he has been chaiman of the sub@@ committee on monetay and financial affais .
the new social policy agenda must not be a mee collection of wods and statements without pactical content .
Saddam Hussein &apos;s egime is indeed epu@@ gn@@ ant : I have been able to see this fo myself in the couse of a numbe of visits ; and it has only got wose .
I conclude that if East Timo needs help , as is in fact the case , this should be povided both by the intenational community and by the eligious and voluntay sectos .
something quite diffeent , howeve , is the document esulting fom the negotiation between the Council and the Commission , quite ightly with the paticipation of M Wij@@ kman , on behalf of Paliament &apos;s Committee on Development , a paticipation which has cetainly contibuted , as Commissione Michel has acknowledged , to the incopoation of many of ou pincipal concens and demands in this field into the &quot; Euopean development consensus &quot; statement .
M Pesident , I would like to point out that the ten yeas of effot it has taken to daw up this document have been ten yeas of constant ageement and coopeation .
fo that eason , Commissione , I would like to disagee slightly with you conclusion that these allocations of EUR 10 million to the Palestinian budget between now and Novembe ae a good thing .
that is why I am saying the legislation must be eviewed in ode to guaantee that these contols by pot authoities ae caied out in all the pots of the Euopean Union .
with egad to the Ameicans , Commission Fischle , I do not think they know a lot about the situation in Euope , but even if they do not say much , they make it clea that they ae in favou of dialogue .
the epot is citical of the ole of the NATO @-@ US occupation and of human ights abuses in Afghanistan , in paticula , the inceased epession of women and highe levels of povety .
I know it is the thid pilla , but it depends on political will .
accoding to ou estimates , thei volume on the global maket is between EUR 9@@ 50 billion and EUR 1 100 billion pe yea , with an expected annual gowth ate of between 5 % and 46 % .
bette access to infomation and geate consume potection ae paticulaly impotant issues , fo example fo the development of the online maket and fo economic gowth thoughout the EU .
as a epesentative of the Goup of the Euopean People &apos;s Paty ( Chistian Democats ) , I took pat in the wok and negotiations on the L@@ ate Pa@@ y@@ ments Diective , which is one of the key legislative poposals announced in the oiginal vesion of the Small Business Act .
M Pesident , Commissione , as you know , I believe tansitional phases should be as few , as shot and as flexible as possible , and in that espect I vey much welcome you eply .
concening Ms K@@ all@@ en@@ bach &apos;s emaks on toys : I hope that , on 12 Septembe , if I am not mistaken , at the next meeting of the Committee on the Intenal Maket and Consume Potection , I will have moe oppotunity to talk about the action taken by the Commission .
as the Euopean Cout of Human Rights has made clea in vey many fundamental ulings , this feedom also extends to pem@@ itting new , contovesial ideas and any kind of discussion , and also entails the feedom to both make mistakes and sha@@ ply citicise the mistakes of othes .
the main issue in this epot is to investigate and addess the impo@@ pe pactices in and aound the Statisti@@ cal Office of the Euopean Communities ( Euostat ) , such as s@@ lus@@ h funds , con@@ y@@ ism , violations of the financial egulations , la@@ x teatment of the mobility ules , and vaious othe things .
the debate is closed .
the ules now being negotiated ae significantly less xen@@ ophobic than M Haade &apos; s poposals .
we ae not giving pope attention to the waning signals fom the financial makets , o fom people such as Pesident Tichet , who indeed called the Commission poposal a good but inadequate step towads stengthening the Stability and Gowth Pact .
what will take place on 16 and 17 Mach could be temed the employes &quot; geneal assembly , and it is no coincidence that it has been scheduled fo shotly befoe the Euopean Council .
we theefoe had to act .
Euope must again become a political poject , and that means , fo example , that the debate on the futue must eally become a lage @-@ scale , albeit difficult , execise in Euopean democacy . it must theefoe be caied out in dialogue with civil society and be moe than a vitual debate on a website being instead a kind of paliamentay assembly of civil society .
both committees did thei best to find pope answes .
indeed , the biggest fames eceive dis@@ popotion@@ ately a geat deal moe than the othes .
I deeply eget the fact that the Council and Paliament have chosen not to hea the potests of the tens of thousands of wokes who , thoughout Euope , have isen up against this poposal fo a diective and who ae today demonstating in Stasboug .
M Pesident , I too should like to expess my sympathy to all the victims .
a tempoay maket situation must not esult in these planned measues with thei long @-@ tem effects .
let me biefly eply to M Swoboda &apos;s questions .
some Membe States , such as Belgium , do so .
M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , I intend to abstain fom the vote on M Lehne &apos;s epot on the White Pape on damages actions fo beach of the EC anti@@ tust ules .
they must not be equied to have the same nationality , howeve , because in pactical tems , this would basically n@@ ul@@ li@@ fy the effects of this poposal .
I am advised that is a complete cac@@ in@@ o@@ gen .
the numbe of votes in favou was much lowe than the numbe of absten@@ tions and of those who , like us , voted against .
in the 1993 epot on measues to pevent the abduc@@ tion of childen , it was again poposed that thee should be bette coodination and use of the Intenational Conven@@ tions of Luxemboug and The Hague .
moeove , the Amstedam Teaty has aleady given a clea diection to the Euopean Union towads this objective as an obligation in the boade sense .
the EU budget must include a budget fo these mico @-@ cedits .
fo these easons ou futue effots and ou goal of impoving social conditions must be ooted in this idea of national and Community pefeence and national and Community potection .
the things that happen in connection with the C@@ lean Development Mechan@@ ism - 60 % of the money goes to China - should not be pemitted .
that will be done in a manne consistent with the legislation as it cuently stands .
a week ago , the Ma@@ yo of the city of L@@ as Pal@@ mas in G@@ an Can@@ aia sent two hunded immigants to Madid with one @-@ way tickets .
this situation will be exacebated afte enlagement .
a dialogue with the epesentatives of employees and employes , consume goups , poduce goups , epesentatives of foeign govenments and envionmental and human ights oganisations is both necessay and desiable .
it means stict pecautions against the kind of illegal pactice which the Commission vey pomptly discoveed in the matte of the adul@@ te@@ ation of the bov@@ ine food chain by human and animal waste , which has happened ecently in some othe counties .
as a Fle@@ ming , I can say as a matte of pinciple , and I speak with some knowledge , that this would be a vey bad idea .
the EU is fa too lage an aea to be able to handle agicultual aid efficiently fo aeas with natual handicap@@ s .
( FR ) Madam Pesident , Afica and Euope talked politics in Lisbon at the highest level , and this is vey good news .
the debate is closed .
I find it vey eve@@ aling that the attempt made by the Euopean Union to act on the Dafu conflict though the Chad mission is effectively in a soy state at the pesent time .
4 . Review of the medical de@@ vice diectives ( vote )
the Regulation is fully in foce and applies to anything elevant to its odes that takes place within the Community .
we cannot allow feedom of the seas to become simply uncontolled feedom to sa@@ il genuine ecological time bombs .
if you wal@@ k though the steets of a Mooccan city , you will see a lot of young people , and that is of couse a vey good thing , but , if these young Mo@@ oc@@ cans ae denied oppotunities , if we do not open up ou maket , even to agicultual poducts - that can be done only step by step athe than ovenight - then these young people have no oppotunities in thei own county , and they stat kno@@ cking on the doos of Euope , as we see them doing in Ceu@@ ta and Me@@ li@@ lla .
we unesevedly suppot the condemnation in Paliament &apos;s esolution of the many anti @-@ Sem@@ i@@ tic attacks in Euope on sy@@ na@@ go@@ gues , Jewish schools and c@@ eme@@ teies .
you ae not listening !
this is pehaps not paticulaly stange , as phamaceutical poducts affect eveyone .
M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , the hamonisation of the vey highly divegen@@ t egulations applicable to civil aviation in Euope , paticulaly to the hous that flight cew wok , is ugently needed .
undestanding the inteests of the US may ensue Euope &apos; s eunification and ability to manage cises .
fo example , L@@ este Bown , who visited us last week , was cho@@ ked by emo@@ tion as he told us emissions would have to be educed by 80 % between now and 2020 if thee is to be any chance of eves@@ ing the tend .
the TEN @-@ T netwoks ae one of the main@@ sta@@ ys of an efficiently functioning maket economy , ceating the conditions fo fai competition on the scale of the entie Euopean Union .
in ode to become an advanced knowledge @-@ based society , not only do we have to be stong on technological eseach and development , that is to say on ou capacity to geneate , absob , assi@@ mi@@ late and communicate new knowledge and capacities to society and to companies , but we also have to be stong on the capacity to convet this knowledge into wealth and social well @-@ being .
finally , we should not ty to define what sevices of geneal inteest and sevices of geneal economic inteest ae , because the wod &quot; economic &quot; applies not to the natue of the sevice itself but to the way in which it is povided .
I stongly suppot the emphasis on pevention and on poviding bette teatment facilities fo addi@@ cts .
the fight against faud , although in lage pat the esponsibility of the Membe States , cannot be conducted solely at the national level .
in pinciple , we do not believe that social and labou maket policy should be a matte fo the Union .
as a esult , I believe that this is a bette balance and , what is moe , the national authoities will still be able to do a lot fo the most nee@@ dy egions .
guaanteed access fo schools , health centes , libaies and so on will beak down baies and help to ensue that fewe people ae left by the wa@@ y@@ side on the infomation supe@@ high@@ way .
a coheent , Community appoach is equied fo both poduction and efficiency .
we should ty to make immigation a facto which stengthens elations and the stability between counties of oigin and destination . we should ceate positive dynam@@ ics which could have an effect in economic tems , intoducing concepts such as &quot; mobility , &quot; which is moe suited to ou times than the igid and bueaucatic ules with which we intend to manage immigation .
animal man@@ ue cannot be the only cause of ni@@ tate pollution , and it is completely uneasonable to tell fames to estict its use if we do not know the othe causes .
we ae opposed to the Geneal Affais Council , without having debated the issue with Paliament and without you having pesented it , taking a unilateal decision containing many elements which clealy clash with the Teaties .
such is the pupose of the amendments which the Goup of In@@ depen@@ dents fo a Euope of Nations has tabled , some of which have been adopted by ou Assembly .
the e@@ C@@ all scheme is a paticulaly valuable initiative .
it had sub@@ po@@ en@@ as which it legally had to meet in the United States of Ameica and that was whee we had the conflict .
finally , one of the opposition leades , M Y@@ a@@ wo@@ v@@ i Ag@@ bo@@ y@@ i@@ bo , was aested and sentenced , a month ago , on tu@@ mp@@ ed @-@ up chages .
the Constitution is a dead duc@@ k , and we have it to thank fo the fact that age @-@ old anim@@ osi@@ ties have fla@@ ed between Membe States , and fo the fact that they ae not even able to agee on the 2007 @-@ 2013 budget .
futhemoe , we must not meely be happy fo Euope to be a continent of consumption .
finally , Madam Pesident , I would like to say that you have done a lot of wok concening tafficking in women within the Euopean Union .
we ae awae that thee ae some intenal difficulties , but you also need to know that Euope will not be able to move fowads without genuine new esouces .
( EL ) Madam Pesident , I too am supised by the position expessed by the Commission hee today because , of couse , we espect the eply as egads the question of subsidiaity and I absolutely agee with the specific demands , but that does not esolve the question of a collective political poposal on the pat of the Euopean Commission which includes all aspects of disastes caused by eathqu@@ akes .
it is impotant to take action that will help those fims to fully ea@@ p the benefits of the single maket .
it is now up to the Commission to decide whethe it wants to do business , o emain at log@@ ge@@ heads with us , in which case we will ob@@ stuct its simplification and ation@@ alisation initiatives and will eve@@ t back to those 16 instuments and all the un@@ wokable mico @-@ management that they entail .
this means that a new ageement will have to be dawn up that will povide bette guaantees egading secuity .
if the situation deteio@@ ates futhe , it could appoach low @-@ key ethnic w@@ af@@ ae as in the case of Buundi .
Fance and Italy have announced a joint initiative to apply fo additional esouces fom the Euopean Union .
( applause )
autho . - ( DE ) M Pesident , M Banie , it is not just in the banking secto that we have egulations that do not wok , but also in the envionmental aea .
thee has been a geat deal of discussion in the United States about CO2 tading , but this has not been followed up by any positive decision @-@ making .
the Luxemboug Pesidency has ightly decided to put eveything into stiving to each an ageement on the financial pespectives befoe the end of June 2005 .
a efom of the ules means consideable levels of investment fo ou industy , so it is impotant that the new ules make it possible fo us to achieve tangible esults with egad to the potection of the envionment .
howeve , the outbeak is not out of contol , as the emaks by some people hee might give the impession .
in witing . - ( DE ) Wit@@ h the new famewok diective on waste , Paliament has now won acceptance fo the establishment of high and binding ecycling quotas .
it will be up to them to decide on an individual basis whethe to choose potection unde the legal system of one o seveal Membe States , o whethe to use the uni@@ tay Euopean patent .
my disg@@ un@@ tled mo@@ od is not caused by the autho of this epot but athe by the Commission which , I believe , has beha@@ ved vey cas@@ ually towads such an impotant aspect of envionmental policy .
to top it all , yesteday it was epoted that you ae being povided with a L@@ ea@@ je@@ t .
an education system which is incapable of passing on basic knowledge , which e@@ places education with taining and which exclu@@ des a significant popotion of young people on the basis of class citeia .
at this point I have the pleasue of welcoming ou fome colleague , M Gi@@ j@@ s de V@@ ies , whom I wish all the stength he needs fo his geat task .
the Geneal Affais and Extenal Relations Council yesteday discussed the anno@@ tated agenda fo the Council that the pesidency had dafted , and I am glad to be able to tell you that the Membe States wholeheatedly endose the list of topics poposed by the pesidency .
M Pesident of the Commission , M Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissione , M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , the pesentation of the Commission &apos;s legislative and wok pogamme fo the yea 2003 constitutes an impotant stage in woking elations between ou two institutions .
this demonstates the special significance of futhe taining in Euope , paticulaly in connection with the combating of unemployment .
this impoved coopeation has to keep up with technological change .
thei health and safety situation is citical .
I would also like to stess that such egulation would by no means esult in the pohibition of tade but would just make sue that tade is possible when it is sustainable .
howeve , the epot could be bette and the contols on lobbyists could be stengthened if you wee to adopt the amendment poposal , which is patly an extension of the statement fom the Committee on Civil Libeties , Justice and Home Affais .
I ealise thee is vey little that we can do hee , but I would like to ask what the Commission and the Council will do to povide legal potection to EU citizens .
if these intentions ae put into pactice , it will be anothe - not the only - dimension of the attack on multilingualism in the Euopean Union , which in@@ si@@ di@@ ously continues making its way though the doo of cost con@@ tainment .
this is the line that concens us , and we ae ight to be concened as , in the constitutional efom poposed by Pesident Chávez , wods such as &apos; decentalisation &apos; , &apos; pivate initiative &apos; , &apos; feedom of competition &apos; and &apos; social justice &apos; have given way to wods such as &apos; Soci@@ alism &apos; , &apos; Socialist &apos; , &apos; imposition of the Socialist State &apos; , &apos; elimination of the independence of the Cental Bank &apos; and &apos; people &apos;s powe &apos; .
I appeciate how difficult it is to assess met@@ als effectively , since the conditions which affect met@@ als to a lage extent , such as ha@@ dness and aci@@ dity , can vay geatly in the Euopean Union .
I can assue you that all of the linguistic vesions will be checked in this espect , M Schnellhadt .
seveal of the facts of the cisis and its aftemath wee not included in the epot , so the final esult is not balanced .

I gathe that you want no moe flags , no an@@ them , and no foeign ministe .
Madam Commissione , you have said that the Commission confims the funding of this poject .
in this secto , too , it is in fact impotant to guaantee a stong , consistent and effective commitment in addition , once again , to tanspaency in decision making and in the implementation pocess , so as to ensue that we give due cedibility to ou actions .
looking fowad caies much moe weight if you have some positive achievements to look back on .
Pesident Podi said a good deal when un@@ vei@@ ling the neighbouhood policy ; he talked about eveything apat fom the institutions .
fo me , though , as an East Geman , it is always stiking how often leades who take office full of lo@@ f@@ ty ideals then , so to speak , distance themselves fom thei own oiginal goals and v@@ isions and take less and less account of the people &apos;s inteests the longe they ae in powe .
( NL ) Madam Pesident , the Council wants to see moe ambition so that we can stengthen competitiveness and incease convegence .
this should be shaed by people in Spain and Potugal .
some fellow Membes ae saying it is a modest package , because it talks of a eduction in geenhouse gases of 20 % .
Commissione Patten ightly said , this moning , that we feel that we have been fus@@ tated in ou desie to contibute to the peace pocess o , to be moe accuate , the esumption of negotiations o , moe pecisely still , cease @-@ fies in Palestine , by the events which have been epeated duing the last few hous .

we must act , by dawing up a Euopean plan to combat paedop@@ hili@@ a .
if I tell you that it was not sent to me and that no mention was made of it at the discussions in Pague , then you must believe me .

2000 : economic and social cohesion
question No 8 by H@@ ug@@ h McMahon ( H @-@ 07@@ 02 / 97 ) :
they cannot be intepeted diffeently fom one county to anothe o fom one egion to anothe , because that eally will cause distotion .
the ecent dop in the euo has been used as a convenient whi@@ pping bo@@ y fo all that has happened ecently with the Euopean Constitution . the poblem is not with the euo .
so , whethe we dink little o much , the damage is thee .
my goup sees it as impotant that the poposals ae appoved quickly and we make pogess on safety issues .
the poduct quality policy can help to incease the competitiveness of Euopean fames and to maintain economic pofits in ual aeas in a time of cisis pecisely by tageting the quality of agicultual poducts and high quality foodstuffs .
nobody knows , and a couple of months ago , we did not even know that such a domin@@ o effect could be set in motion .
lastly , the moatoium and the pecautionay pinciple : this is not a question of asse@@ ting a pinciple , the pecautionay pinciple , which was established in the context of food safety , and tansfeing it whol@@ esale to foeign policy .
I am sue you ae ight , Commissione , that figues can mean many things and we need to look vey caefully at them .
this has been confimed in studies , and paticulaly im@@ pes@@ sively by the ST@@ O@@ A study fom the yea 2000 .
let us not look just to 1 % , let us look to 2 % and make sue that we do have a genuine soft landing fo milk quotas .
we ae in the midst of a cisis of confidence and I must say to you , M Baoso , that although what you said this moning may be tue , it gives the impession not that we will look fo the best solutions and put them in place , but instead that we will discuss the minimum consensus which we can each on Fiday .
you say , on behalf of the Council , that you fully endose what the Commissione has just said . I can tell you that , fo us , this will be a satisfactoy declaation .
in tems of schools , that means we must fist of all infom paents and teaches , so that they can ecognise and pomote the Euopean dimension of education and taining jointly with the young people involved .
in the Community action it is poposed that decisions on the intoduction of ules on enty should be taken by qualified majoity and that is vey positive .
this efom is ugent with a view to enlagement to avoid institutional collapse .
I am also pleased that the deadlines set by this ecast diective egading tansposition and sanctions fo failue to implement the text have been educed in compaison with the initial poposal .
the intenational wok should be conducted by the United Nations and othe oganisations .
anothe impotant outcome of the negotiations concens payments .
late on we ae going to talk with you about the stess tests , in othe wods the safety analyses fo the 14@@ 3 nuclea powe plants .
thee is one final point I would also like to mention : the documentation of especially suitable pojects , thoughout Euope , should help facilitate access to community life fo all Euopean citizens .

though the centuies we have witnessed , and sometimes caused , the suff@@ ein@@ gs of the people of Isael .
that sot of thing should not happen .
it is the quality of the pocess that is cucial , not the temp@@ o .
sustainable development must become the goal of the steps we take with egad to cohesion , as Jacques Delos emphasised as long ago as 1993 .

of couse , eveything possible should be done to pevent faud .
thidly , the injued paties ae entitled to apid financial compensation .
the futue enlagement of the Euopean Union to incopoate the ten cental and easten Euopean counties is the most damatic development eve to be contemp@@ lated o undetaken by the Union .
the Euopean institutions have to be seved by the vey best .
we have been told that Ieland has spent the Stuctual Funds unde the pesent Community Sup@@ pot Famewok 1994 @-@ 1999 vey she@@ w@@ dly with the consequ@@ ent economic benefits .
apat fom this basic conflict , the othe mid @-@ tem adap@@ tations ae consensus between the thee institutions ( with the exception of the IC@@ I + ) .
my second point is a sincee equest fo us not to lose sight of the development of ou coopeation in the aeas of science and eseach as well as in the aea of civil society .
( the sitting was closed at 12.@@ 40 )
in Euope , ou citizens fea fo thei safety , and with good eason .

John Mol@@ loy of the Dublin Ma@@ ine Institute - as you can see I do not mention any Spanish scientists hee - said that &apos; fishemen ae scientists &apos; and that we need to use the aft of fist @-@ hand infomation they have , which is cuently being ignoed .
we need social secuity and not Euopean milita@@ ism .
though today &apos;s esolution Paliament gants the Diecto of the Euopean R@@ ailway Agency dischage in espect of the implementation of the Agency &apos;s budget fo the financial yea 2009 .
on the O@@ des@@ sa @-@ B@@ od@@ y @-@ G@@ da@@ ń@@ sk pipeline , I would like to say that the Commission is making evey effot to divesify EU enegy supplies and outes and , of couse , Cental Asia is absolutely cucial hee .
M Pesident , it is thanks to the efom of the Rules of Pocedue that we ae hee today discussing a text which - as has happened on many , too many occasions in Paliament - will be adopted by the Council in a diffeent fom fom that in which it was submitted , while we ae denied the chance to debate the Euopean Union &apos;s poposals on teoism , which ae much moe impotant in tems of the ights and feedoms of the Euopean citizens than the document we ae now comp@@ elled to debate .

it is clea to all patnes in the Euopean Union that we want to continue to actively pomote the cause of the campaign against capital punishment , at the United Nations and elsewhee , but I would , at the same time , like to make it clea that this is still a vey difficult aea , and so any campaign against the death penalty will only meet with success if the Euopean Union &apos;s actions ae step by step and well thought @-@ out .
to close , I should like to put a equest to the Council and the Commission : at some point , even if unity is found between Hamas and Fa@@ ta@@ h , you must decide on the Union &apos;s futue policy in this secto , whee the mistakes of the past must not be epeated , with the Euopean Union negotiating selec@@ tively with half the govenment and po@@ inte@@ dly ignoing the othe half , egadless of whethe the entie govenment was the outcome of fee and democatic elections .
on this point the Commission &apos;s esponse to a equest in the Decembe 1995 Envionment Council will be to pesent a communication on a Community stategy to combat aci@@ di@@ fication .
M Pesident , thank you , M Pap@@ adi@@ mou@@ lis , fo you thoough wok on this epot .
I also want to emind you that the pocedue povided fo in Aticle 13@@ 8 ( 3 ) leaves the legislative initiative in this aea in the hands of the Euopean Paliament , and it will be the Council which establishes the elevant povisions , acting unanimously afte obtaining the Paliament &apos;s assent .
that equies a geat deal of pesua@@ sion of ou tading patnes , the emeging economies , who we need to pesuade to buy into and sign up to the post @-@ 2012 ageement that we all agee is geatly needed and which needs to have the maximum geogaphical coveage .
the An@@ dia epot is impotant to place the subject of housing on the Euopean political agenda .
some measues that have been adopted ae aimed in this diection , such as the eduction in ve@@ to@@ ing ights in the Euopean Council o the seeds of a Euopean public teas@@ uy .
this figue was based on statistics supplied by the OECD fo all Community institutions .
I would like to make just one suggestion , since the statement about the institutional pesence of Euopean Membes of Paliament within the Euopean Council Paliamentay Assembly when meeting to appoint the judge and the judges is somewhat vague : I would say that thee is a small poblem with the elationship between the population of Euope , of the Euopean Union , and the populations of othe counties .
in some espects we have been athe slow off the mak in this aea , but we ealise that this development has consideable potential , not only fo navigation but also fo safety , and that it offes majo oppotunities in tems of uban and non @-@ uban taffic management .
with egad to sevices , duing this month evised quality offes should be pesented and , with egad to sevices elating to the basic needs of the citizens , I do not believe that the developing counties should be equied to libealise them .
that is difficult to accept , especially in view of Russia &apos;s membeship of the Council of Euope and the Russian authoities &apos; ealie declaations on espect fo human ights .
thee is no common legal famewok in Euope which egul@@ ates all mattes involving faud .
a situation in which cetain counties move fowad by tans@@ posing and implementing diectives , whilst othes da@@ g thei feet , is simply unacceptable .
we came close to esolving these issues ove the last few days - I had expected them to be esolved if not yesteday , then cetainly this moning .
this use of the wod &apos; Macedon@@ ian &apos; cannot be eplaced by any efeence to any state name .
anyone who wishes to epesent people politically must follow these ules .
howeve , the situation at pesent is that we ae foced to impot a lot of ou feed and I have said many times befoe that I stongly believe that the pocess of appoving new types of GMO gain fo impot is taking fa too long , and feed@@ stu@@ ff fom soya ugently equies to be spee@@ ded up .
in spite of political statements , ecommendations , action pogammes and special legislation at national level , women ae still unde @-@ epesented in politics .
duing the seven weeks in which we closely co@@ opeated , I had aleady been impessed by the input of my own staff who had been woking like hell .
finally , to ou patnes fom the Council and the Commission , I would like to say that we hope that this occasion can help us to develop a deepe stategic dialogue between Paliament , the Council and the Commission which will bing moe democatic legitimacy to the had wok you ae doing , M Solana and Ms Feeo @-@ Waldne , in ode to have moe coopeation in ou tian@@ gle .
M Delos also said something else that , fo a euo@@ scep@@ tic such as myself , almost gives me a sense of dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u in elation to aguments that I put fowad on a pevious occasion .
as fa as contols on bag@@ gage ae concened , Aticle 1 of Regulation No 3@@ 9@@ 25 / 91 povides that the emoval of contols on bag@@ gage at intenal fonties is to apply , except fo those checks linked to pohibi@@ tions o estictions laid down by the Membe States , povided they ae compatible with the thee Teaties establishing the Euopean Communities .
I am fimly convinced that the line I followed in attempting to esolve this in the manne in which I did was the coect way to poceed .
you might think this incap@@ acity on the pat of counties to pusue an active policy of enewable enegy development - an incap@@ acity which is explained paticulaly by the lage economic inteests of the enegy lobby - would lead the Euopean Union to compensate fo these fail@@ ings , to have an appoach fa moe in keeping with the geneal inteest , to clim@@ b above all these mec@@ en@@ ay inteests .
R@@ esponsibilities ae clealy indicated and unambiguous sanctions ae imposed in the event of non @-@ compliance .
may I say that it is pecisely this willingness to peseve the single maket in that secto that led the Commission some time ago to intevene in a simila way in the case of two othe Membe States , inteventions fom which UK bee poduces among othes , benefited .
as Potuguese Pime Ministe , M Baoso , you in pactice pusued the opposite policy to that which is fundamental to us in the PSE Goup .
empty cat@@ ch@@ phases can no longe pac@@ if@@ y the citizens of the EU , no can they cus@@ hi@@ on the impact of a falling bith ate and inceasing povety .
owing to financial inteests , I shall abstain fom voting on this epot and the following fou .
is thee any piece within the legislation o the poposal that would allow fo the cout to ignoe the necessity fo evey single document to be tanslated into the language ?
today , the Euopean Paliament is not intefeing in Pakistan &apos;s intenal affais , but is only calling attention to Aticle 20 of Pakistan &apos;s 197@@ 3 Constitution and the feedom of eligion fo which it povides .
M Pesident , allow me to begin by congatulating Ms A@@ vil@@ és Pe@@ ea on he excellent epot . my congatulations ae sincee because she has been able to deal in a full and balanced way with the consequences which globalisation have had on the wold of immigation , specifically fo women and in paticula fo women fom the southen egion of the Mediteanean .
I am also sue that Euopean Union funds should be used to modenise o eplace boadband netwoks that do not povide access with a sufficient taffic volume .

thee is a big isk : the theat to biodivesity .
at its meeting on 2 July 2004 , the Council stessed the need to give paticula consideation to the popotionality of the measue in elation to costs , pivacy and efficiency .
we do indeed want to incease the capacity to act .
Rathe sceptical though it has been , the Social Democatic govenment has , fo all that , continued with the successful libealisation pogamme set out by the ight of cente govenment at the beginning of the 1990s .

the package you ae about to adopt cetainly epesents a geat sti@@ de in the ight diection and - I eiteate - a geat political message , a geat sign of will by the Euopean institutions to povide answes to the questions asked by 500 million citizens .
unfotunately the IGC has not made any convincing poposals on this scoe .

M Pesident , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , in his explanatoy statement the appoteu states that the Pestige accident highlights the impotance , among othe things , of adequately monitoing full compliance with existing Euopean and intenational egulations on maitime safety .
as M van Velzen has aleady noted , it is in my view impotant to make a clea distinction between authenti@@ cation sevices and confidentiality sevices .
M Pesident , I should fist like to point out that the Commission also believes that ou elations with the United States ae essential , but that must neve stop us fom fimly caying out the actions needed to defend the Union &apos;s inteests .

Euope has also passed 25 bilateal ageements with counties including Angola , the Seych@@ elles and Madagas@@ ca and is attempting to come to an ageement with Moocco , no mean pocess and one that is cuently in difficulties .

the Membe States have been woking with the so @-@ called boad guidelines of economic policy fo ove two yeas , without managing to develop conceted and coodinated economic policies .

the Sping Council tomoow needs to bi@@ te the bul@@ let and name and shame those Membe States who have failed to open up thei gas makets .
unfotunately , Poland does not have the monopoly on hom@@ ophobia , which is , egettably , to be found thoughout the wold .
as M Sping said to the ME@@ N@@ A Confeence , the Union is a fiend fo the bad times as well as fo the good times and ou commitment to the pocess is fo the long hau@@ l as long as it is necessay fo a just , compehensive and lasting peace to be established in the Middle East .
we know that it is not the case , and fo this eason I vey much hope thee will be seious consequences and that we will be able to tell the public that we ae taking cae of thei safety and not just peten@@ ding that we ae .
in paticula , we need to wok on the basis of a set of ageed pinciples and ules fo Membe States &apos; budgetay policies .
we ae going to put the last question to the Commissione .
they ae both pen@@ insul@@ as , with sea on thee sides and land on one .
following the Commission &apos;s decision on Chal@@ eo@@ i , we feel this pinciple should be upheld in espect of the TEN@@ s and in paticula the motoways of the sea element of the pogamme .
the eality is also the existence of autonomous machiney fo egion@@ alized sp@@ aces fo fee movement of pesons like that of the Nodic P@@ ass@@ pot Union .

M Pesident , ou Austian colleague is ight in saying this is not the fist time we ae discussing Zimbabwe in this House .
the pupose of this poposal fo a egulation is to ensue that accuate infomation is povided to the Commission on a egula basis egading EU investment pojects in enegy infastuctue to enable it to fulfil its duties , especially those elated to its contibution to the Euopean enegy policy .
Madam Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to give this esolution my un@@ failing suppot , as it undelines the elevance of Opeation A@@ tal@@ anta and its success .
I would begin in the usual way by thanking the appoteus , Ms Dühkop Dühkop , M Vi@@ ola and cetainly M Giansily as well .
howeve complicated the Lisbon Teaty atification might have been in the end , it cannot be an excuse fo the Commission , which failed to submit the daft of the new budget stuctue on time .
the second sensitive issue is the Westen Sahaa .
this means , among othe things , that access fo all to a divese cultue and to education must be guaanteed within a context of espect fo Community law and that the value of the ceative wok of authos and pefom@@ es , including in the digital economy , must be duly ecognised .
to conclude , I think we have eached a fai compomise which aims to pomote , in accodance with the povisions of the Åhus Convention , effective implementation of Community legislation on the envionment . I could , pehaps , summaise it by saying &quot; the whole Åhus Convention , and nothing but the Åhus Convention . &quot;
howeve , Commissione , the Commission has not so fa played its pat satisfactoily .
we in this House must encouage initiatives that will ceate wok acoss ou continent .
combating illegal immigation should be pat of a much boade agenda - an agenda to han@@ ess the benefits of immigation , athe than va@@ in@@ ly tying to stop it .
fo the fist time , foeignes have been abduc@@ ted and sho@@ ts fied at touists .
the cli@@ ent must have the ight of access to legal ules and judicial and administative bodies , with the aim of guaantee that sevices ae potected as fa as possible and that , within the context of the equiements indicated by M Gagani and M Lehne , we can guaantee fee competition , both within each of the counties of the Union and acoss the Union &apos;s bodes .
this would obviously mean that the Commission may have to evo@@ ke o change that ule , but it will be able to discuss the most appopiate way of achieving contol by the Euopean Paliament without this involving any intefeence in the executive ole of the Commission o a slo@@ wing @-@ down of the executive pocess in such a way as to pejudice citizens &apos; ights .
is it any wonde that Fench o Bitish citizens show little enthusiasm fo a new teaty , when two of ou longe seving leades have ab@@ jec@@ tly failed to explain and justify the Union to thei compati@@ ots ?

in addition , at the last meeting held within the ASEAN goup , statements wee made by the In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans which could be descibed as innovative ; we shall soon see what esults they bing .
this means , although I know M Swoboda is not doing this , that the willing , highly pofessional , dedicated and , as Pesident Podi ealie said , highly @-@ motivated civil sevice of the Euopean Union can be mis@@ epesented in@@ fam@@ ously in the pess and elsewhee by a vey small minoity who ae exten@@ ally but not intenally egaded as epesentative .
the next step is fo the citizens of the EU to be given the citizens &apos; initiative .
we must of couse ask ouselves whethe thee is any altenative to this policy . it is ou belief that , given the fact that Hamas is an oganisation that is on the list of teoist oganisations and gives no indication of any tendency to acknowledge the fundamental pinciples to which I have efeed , the Euopean Union has no choice but to adopt a policy of suspen@@ ding diect payments to this govenment , although it is to be hoped that this will be only a tempoay measue .
as fa as the complex matte of combating faud is concened , the call of the five W@@ ise M@@ en fo a Euopean Po@@ secu@@ tion Office aised e@@ ye@@ bo@@ ws and ightly so .
the appoteu has identified thee key sectos in which Community intevention and Membe States &apos; commitment ae necessay . these ae the ceation of entepeneuship at the educational level , the pomotion of the taining of wokes , and the pomotion of innovation among small and medium @-@ sized entepises ( SMEs ) .
this amounts to about 16 deaths a day .
I would like to thank Commissione McCeevy fo his statement today and to say that it is vey impotant that we think of the Euopean Union as a community .

I hope the solutions poposed may find a boad consensus in Paliament in ode to give geate stength to the aguments of all those in the Council and the Commission of the Euopean Union that shae them .

moeove , the Euopean Social Fund ( ESF ) suppots the Euopean Employment Stategy and the policies of Membe States on full employment , quality and poductivity at wok , pomotes social inclusion , paticulaly access to employment fo disadvantaged people , and educes employment inequalities at national , egional and local levels .
but it is also tue that the moment you behave like the teoists , you undemine you moal authoity and you au@@ g@@ ment the numbe of citizens who eithe actively o pas@@ sively suppot them .
accession will only be successful if the counties catch up with the existing membes .
that is the eason why the Euope of politics and values that you mentioned cannot put a stop to its pogess , and cannot give up on developing its ole as a majo intenational playe and as the epesentative of peace in the face of a numbe of se@@ tbacks .

fom time to time we have to call in expets to help ou sevices ; not fo taking decisions as such but fo tying to con@@ stu@@ e the facts .
Madam Pesident , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , ou debate this evening poves once again that enegy is not a commodity like any othe .
about one month late , on 21 Octobe , I had the oppotunity to listen to you speech in Malta , at an impotant but cetainly infomal meeting - I efe to the Foum of Wokes and Po@@ fes@@ sional As@@ soci@@ ations . even though you did not efe to the Paliamentay debate , you adopted many of the obsevations that we had made in this House and in committee .
it is impotant in its own ight but also foms the basis fo activities based on natual esouces such as agicultue and the fishing industy .
finally thee ae seveal points which , although they ae also to be decided by the newly elected Paliament , ae mattes on which we ought to make pogess in the high @-@ level goup ove the next few weeks , and if possible by the ECOFIN Council on 25 May . we need a poposal fo the five membes of the supevisoy committee to which eveyone can agee ; we need a job desciption fo the Diecto of OLAF so that the job adveti@@ sement can be published ; and , as ou colleagues in the Committee on Budgets have aleady ecommended in thei opinion , we need an establishment plan fo OLAF so that a supplementay budget can be ageed on that basis .
in this egad , the Easten Patneship is an effective instument and an ou@@ tle@@ t fo the Euopean aspiations of the Republic of Moldova &apos;s citizens .
ai taffic emissions ae not included in the CO2 calculations , and tanspot is being pomoted all ove Euope .
this significantly en@@ danges a futue eduction of the tax buden and leads to the liqui@@ dation en mas@@ se of small and medium @-@ sized entepises .
the legal povisions , which Ms Cal@@ otti mentioned , do not theefoe pesent an obstacle .
the budget pocess is not just fo the ano@@ aks like myself and othes who ae sitting aound hee , eveyone in this House is accountable to Euopean citizens fo the decisions this House makes on the budget .
an eight @-@ yea peiod was povided pecisely fo the pupose of caying out vaious studies and adopting legislation .
thank you , Ms Peijs , fo you explanations , thanks to all of you and also thanks to the conciliation pocedue which has enabled this positive decision to be taken today .
human ights ae once again at the m@@ ecy of economic o militay contol , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the &apos; wa on teo &apos; of the Bush administation .
he shows absolute contempt fo the people of Fance and Holland who voted &apos; no &apos; but , moe seiously , he shows absolute contempt fo the vey pocess of democacy itself .
the Euopean Union has been avoiding this fo a long time .
fist of all , I should like to thank the Austian Pesidency fo the constuctive way in which this dossie was bought to a favouable conclusion .
the fist is to do moe to get the Membe States to submit national declaations .
I will pass on you equest , M Pa@@ tak@@ is , and I am sue we will find a way fo you to take the floo .
I appeciate the position of the many honouable Membes who advocate vocational taining hee .
taditional ual achitectue disappeaed quickly , and vey little of it emains today , which means thee is all the moe eason fo us to make evey effot to ensue this heitage is effectively peseved .
let me give you a pesonal example : while Hungay was a candidate fo accession to the EU , the Commission obliged us to comply with evey last povision of the legislation , but now that we ae a Membe State , anything goes .
we should not be using shock logic to in@@ vent legal ules that wee allegedly boken .
without innovations thee would not be any genei@@ cs , but at the same time genei@@ cs play an impotant ole in peventing innovations fom becoming so pohibi@@ tively expensive that the health secto cannot affod them .
I vey much welcome them both .
M Pesident , well , we ae supposed to stay co@@ ol when following a debate , but this debate has got out of hand and it has liteally gone with the wind , and with it has gone honesty and ation@@ alism .
please allow me , as leade of the Sloven@@ e delegation in the PPE @-@ DE , to expess my sincee gatitude fo you contibution and paticulaly fo the attention that you have shown towads Slovenia .
M Pesident , we ae going to help Noth Koea .
peventive activities should pimaily be tageted at the pooest seg@@ ments of society and at the goups most at isk since it is they who espond bette to this type of infomation campaign .
we need to stop talking and stat acting .
consequently , thee is a need to ensue that people living in ual aeas eceive a high standad of health cae , education , child cae and othe sevices intended to meet daily needs and which would ceate moe favouable living conditions and would educe social exclusion .
unfotunately , as M Pi@@ menta has aleady pointed out , this moning &apos;s news demonstates that othe oganizations like the Euopean Bank fo Reconstuction and Development do not seem willing to investigate in any seious fom though these cost option studies othe possible ways of solving East and Cental Euope &apos;s enegy poblems .
this investigation is unde way .
only the povisional studies in elation to the tunnel , including theefoe the envionmental studies , ae being co@@ financed though the opeational pogamme fo oad netwoks within the famewok of EU aid to Geece fo 1994 @-@ 1999 .
all Membe States of the Euopean Union should be speaking with one voice at the United Nations to put pessue on the authoities to take action at that level .
we know , and have taken account of this in ou amendments , that is why a compo@@ und including ni@@ ckel and cop@@ pe is needed .
we have aleady had some expeience with libealisation in Euope - in the UK and in the Nethelands as well .
I would also diect the House &apos; s and the Commission &apos; s attention to Amendment No 9 which povides the oppotunity to use ch@@ loo@@ flou@@ oc@@ ab@@ ons in cetain extemely special cases , fo example to offe pain elief to people who ae seiously ill .
the Ma@@ gn@@ it@@ sky case , efeed to in the epot , follows the mudes of Polit@@ kov@@ sa@@ ya , Este@@ mi@@ o@@ va and Bab@@ u@@ o@@ va .
in this egad , it is a geat disappointment to me that the ole of local authoities is not sufficiently eflected in the EU 2020 stategy .
accodingly , this secto of the fleet needs suppot at both national and Community level .
with egad to the conclusion of the Potocol between the Euopean Union and the Pin@@ cip@@ ality of An@@ doa extending to customs secuity measues the Ageement , which has until now been in the fom of an Ex@@ change of L@@ et@@ tes between the Euopean Economic Community and the Pin@@ cip@@ ality of An@@ doa and which was concluded on 28 June 1990 . the Ageement was the basis fo the customs union between both paties .
it would be vey stange indeed if duing tomoow &apos;s vote , we fist demonstated ou alle@@ gi@@ ance to a moe coheent appoach to waste ship@@ ments , only to sho@@ ot this unifom appoach to ta@@ ttes the next day .
this can quali@@ ta@@ tively impove the employment oppotunities of young people in a numbe of Membe States , including Spain and othes whee the situation is the most difficult and whee the efom of the education system was eithe delayed o ignoed in the ecent peiod .
fistly , while the Commission is tying to find innovative solutions to an unpecedented disaste , I would uge it to emain pagmatic about the impact of this gestue .
the scope o quantity of these activities ae thus in a way adapted to the enlaged Euopean Union .
expeience will show whethe the n@@ as@@ cent libealisation of the Euopean ailways will mean bette sevices fo ail uses .
in the cuent economic climate , we also see many poduces in despeate situations and who ae foced to stop faming because thei income is insufficient .
( FR ) M Pesident , fo some time now , the influx of migants has been pota@@ yed as a seem@@ ingly unacceptable theat .
Q@@ im@@ onda &apos;s ability to attact much needed skilled wokes to the egion has now been com@@ pomised .
consume policy should be based on guaanteeing high levels of consume potection .
we think it is impotant fo the Euopean Paliament to demonstate its espect fo human ights within the Euopean Union .
this is not the appoteu &apos;s fault as the Convention itself , which had consideed including a definition of this woking method in its text fo a Euopean constitution , eventually gave up due to the difficulties in doing so ( Aticle I @-@ 14 of the cuent daft ) .
I was highly citical of the supevisoy aangements even duing the debate on the 2005 amendment .
howeve , if we daw togethe the opinion on cy@@ be@@ cime and Paliament &apos; s opinion on teoism , it is quite stiking that a geat many things ae thown togethe and cimin@@ alised : fo example , &quot; eveything which is illegal off@@ line should be illegal online &quot; .
we must be much toughe towads the two playes , Ukaine and Russia , N@@ af@@ to@@ ha@@ z and Gazpom .
so the appoteu is poposing , in the context of measues pio to the new acces@@ sions , that cetain counties should assume full financial esponsibility fo entie sectos of thei national pogamme , with ex post contol applying instead of ex ante contol .
we will thus conside the potential fo pogess beyond 2012 , and the 120 g objective , on the basis of an impact assessment .
that is the eality .
thee ae so many ailway systems , and they ae not only diffeent in each Membe State , but in many cases , diffeent systems ae in use in a single Membe State , and the systems we ae talking about ae often a potectionist administative baie put up only to potect the monopoly fim in the national maket .
one of the things that is being ageed with M Podi &apos; s Commission is that the Commissiones will attend if the subject unde discussion concens them .
we need moe in the way of Euope .
if the co@@ igen@@ dum is adopted , will you still be having a vote ?
its incease , as a goss figue , is half due to the significant incease in the amounts given ove to ual development .
tanspot is gowing by about 7 % to 10 % pe yea .
now we must move on to the next question .
if you wait until you ae weak , you have to take much geate action and lay off moe people .
the M@@ P@@ F delegation fimly suppots the Galileo poject fo the implementation of a Euopean satellite adi@@ on@@ avi@@ gation pogamme , a system that will wok paallel to yet independently of the Ameican GPS system whilst maintaining &apos; inteopeability &apos; , in othe wods , it will not wok against this system and will pemit the possibility fo the two systems to wok togethe .
the Membe States &apos; contibutions via the fouth esouce o VAT must be popotionate with thei contibution to the Community GDP as a key element of safeguading the equity of the system .
of couse , Membe States ae esponsible fo pefoming these checks , and the suveillance of and checks on teitoial wates ae theefoe a matte of thei competence .
the &apos; peviously &apos; cetainly does not efe to the fact that they wee pesent in pevious months , but most definitely to when the qu@@ oum equest was made .
we must espond with fim and pactical measues , with financial commitments , with a wold wate teaty , pomoting a good wate cultue .
I have myself been able to witness how delays in the exchange of infomation between the diffeent legal systems can diectly benefit the ciminals .
I should like to e @-@ emphasise a point made by a numbe of Membes .
M Pesident , the vey fact that the Euopean Envionment Agency estimates that only 10 to 20 % of the wates in the Euopean Union now meet the good wate quality equiements should in itself make evey sensible peson sit up and think .
it sets out the objective of the &apos; ceation of a ...
it is moe than natual that I say a wod about Geogia .
integation is supposed to be appaent in many key aeas , yet we ae expeiencing maked delays in the full integation of the new Membe States .
and if this is valid and necessay fo industy in geneal , and to peseve jobs , it is even moe so in the case of the Euopean textile and clothing industy , which has a tunove of EUR 19@@ 6 billion evey yea , involves moe than 1@@ 13 000 businesses , povides wok fo two million people - o 7.@@ 6 % of total employment in the manufactuing industy - and is chaacteised by significant egional concentation .
my goup would like to add two futhe conditions .
the second majo efom is obviously the efom of the Stability and Gowth Pact caied out in 2005 , which allows us today to have a policy that is conta@@ cy@@ cli@@ cal and aimed at coun@@ teing the cisis .
you may emembe that , in M Podi &apos; s in@@ augu@@ al speech to this House , he spoke of the new Commission &apos; s desie to be on close tems with the people and , in this context , he emphasised the impotance of fighting the scouge of dugs .
the text was submitted to us fo appoval and I decided to vote in favou , since it pimaily concens itself with development in South Afica .
I am happy to suppot this epot .
we shall follow the negotiations not least because of that .
howeve , simultaneously , my goup has always pointed out that the Euopean Aest Waant system would be incomplete without advancing pocedual defence ights in Euope .
we can also show solidaity by showing financial solidaity .
the pogamme is also useful , fo example , on account of the close co@@ elation between the scouge of AIDS and the hunge poblem .
M Fei@@ o &apos;s epot points out ways and defines stategies towads a eal stengthening of economic govenance and the EU &apos;s stability famewok , with the main focus on the euo aea .
Paliament and the Council each appoint thee membes of the Boad .
majo egions of the I@@ bei@@ an Pen@@ insula ae on the bin@@ k of desetification .
M Pesident , we once again have an ugent debate on Vietnam and Laos .
it is in ou name that these babaic acts ae caied out , and in ou name that these teible deeds ae done .
fistly , the question of the Commission .
finally , I must point out to Ms Main@@ uc@@ c@@ i that ideas such as , and I quote , having &apos; to povide a place in schools whee young people can discuss equal oppotunities &apos; is the sot of idiculous nonsense that has no place in a paliamentay epot , and that even the Euopean Paliament needs to have some sot of minimum standads .
may I also point out that the English text of Amendment 31 should be put to the vote , as I have noticed that a vey impotant wod has been om@@ itted fom the Fench and Geman texts .
the second point that I wish to make is this : the negotiating pocess launched unde the auspices of the UN Secetay @-@ Geneal was paaly@@ sed fo a vey long time by the outight opposition of the Tukish Cypiots .
it is incomplete , but it is a good basis fo peace in Euope .
howeve , it is also necessay that the paliamentaians epesent the same Euopean people by ensuing that thee is no fi@@ vol@@ ous spending , no unnecessay pice inceases , and that value is found in a maket whee supplies and bus@@ in@@ es@@ spe@@ ople ae fighting fo evey last euo .
have you eve consideed that the easten end of these jouneys is not in Russia at all , but in Belaus , a county that has not been mentioned in these discussions at all ?
having a chance to feely tavel to the EU is not only a pactical advantage , but it has also , in many cases , taken away psychological baies and econ@@ nec@@ ted people .
amending the Financial Regulation is a small but significant step on the way to the thid stage of monetay union .
the Isaelis have failed to espect the intenational community .
a new policy must be established to pocess asylum seekes at the point of aival in the EU , by means of a Community @-@ wide esettlement scheme and by means of potected enty pocedues .

this is the foundation fo this poposal fo a egulation : in othe wods , applying Aticle 20@@ 7 ( 1 ) of the Teaty on the Functioning of the Euopean Union ( T@@ F@@ EU ) , which povides fo the exclusive competence of the EU in mattes of foeign diect investment as pat of the common commecial policy .
I said it will aise the an@@ ten@@ n@@ ae of Ms Van Di@@ jk when she he@@ as that and when I saw he name up to make a statement .
the Euopean Union is still willing to pusue contacts with the neighbouing counties in the egion with a view to de @-@ escalation of tensions in nothen Iaq .
we note with concen the evidence that the goups - and , so one ga@@ thes , the Commission - ae discussing how to use long @-@ tem financial planning as a means of ti@@ mm@@ ing this aea athe than extending it , o the possibility of putting it unde the Stuctual Funds .
that is why the futue of a fedeal Iaq looks vey fagile .
the postal sevice is a majo activity secto in Euope .
we ecognize , howeve , that the ban may ceate significant shot @-@ tem poblems fo some of the Membe States , and , in view of that , we have povided fo the possibility of a deogation of limited duation in ode to give those Membe States slightly moe time in which to make the necessay adjustments .
we hee in the Euopean Paliament should , by means of today &apos;s esolution , make clea once again that the woldwide costs of failue to abolish hunge ae enomously high .
I would also like to congatulate the Council fo having finally seen sense , assisted , it must be said , by the intoduction of qualified majoity voting .
do not foget that the Diective epesents a model of neighbou@@ ly elations and theeby gives a signal of whethe o not the EU wants to be an open society o to e@@ ec@@ t baies against neighbouing states along its bodes .
I could go on and on .
moeove , the ecession is taking the EU Membe States into deepe economic unification and we must take advantage of this to consolidate the Euopean economy so that it is moe competitive at both domestic and intenational level .

if you wish to make any othe emaks you will have to take them up bilate@@ ally with colleagues .
this is not to mention the supply chain , whee lage numbes of jobs will also be lost .

I poposed an amendment , which I am pleased was accepted by my colleagues , that makes sue that the . &quot; EU &quot; egistation is not em@@ poweed to issue any sub @-@ domain names using Membe State identities .
I say that if we go down this oad only , then we ae not seeing the full pictue .
at the same time , howeve , we conside it a majo poblem that thee is no sepaate epot , o even a sepaate paagaph , on national minoities , since we - and Commissione Feeo @-@ Waldne ove thee - will be oves@@ eeing Kosovo , and we will be detemining what happens as egads minoity ights .
waste legislation will also pobably be completed duing you Pesidency .
how should we espond ?
moeove , the Council gave no esponse at all to the Euopean Paliament &apos;s ecommendations concening the common policy and ou call fo a common defence policy is being totally ignoed .
the suggestions put fowad in this aea povide a moe effective solution to potecting human health and the envionment .
it is this aspect in paticula which is the matte of focused attention by the Commission , although natually we ae among the many people ight acoss the Union who hope that the epots that the dispute may be esolved by the coming weekend tun out to be coect .
ciminals in Euope ae no longe fee to exploit ou open bodes in the way that they might othewise have been able to .
Madam Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , a happy outcome is woth waiting fo , as the saying goes .
on behalf of the ALDE Goup . - ( IT ) M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , a teible tagedy in my county has hit the impotant cental egion of the Abu@@ zz@@ o and the city of A@@ qu@@ ila .
the exact numbe of people suffeing fom the disease is not known .
the Slovak Republic is in favou of sticte and toughe pocedues .
these measues ae adequate and I tust that they will indeed be only tansitional .
the Commission welcomes , and theefoe accepts , Amendments Nos 1 and 3 because it shaes Paliament &apos;s wish to stive fo geate secuity in tems of monitoing pecus@@ os and dugs .
the Commission too must demonstate social esponsibility and sound management .
in witing . - This is the fist epot on Ian in Paliament since the Gah@@ le Repot in 2001 .
it is impotant , in ou view , fo the enlagement pocedue to include the application of efficient measues to pevent and combat tafficking in women , postitution , sexual abuse of childen and child ponogaphy in the candidate counties , given that many of these counties ae still the counties of oigin , tansit and destination fo intenational oganised cime netwoks in the moden sla@@ ve tade .
of couse , the decentalised management of the pogamme which we have opted fo is a vey demanding method of management .
M Pesident , on behalf of myself and seveal othe MEPs , while I fully espect the solem@@ n natue of today &apos; s fomal sitting , I wish to make a point of ode unde Rule 19 out of concen fo human ights given that the Colom@@ bian Pesident &apos; s visit today is esticted to his paliamentay addess until a fomal din@@ ne with heads of political goups .
they only diffe by fou lettes but that cetainly makes a vey big diffeence at the budgetay level .
in this espect , the Commission needs to adically change its policy , as I said yesteday when discussing the Te@@ ón i Cus@@ í epot .
( DE ) M Pesident , I am glad to see that this House will , with immediate effect , be putting integation capacity at the heat of the enlagement debate , fo the success of the enlagement pocess , and of a moe pofound pocess of Euopean integation , depend on it .
as no othe legal basis on access to documents is povided in the Teaty , the egulation on Aticle 2@@ 55 will be the famewok fo all othe seconday legislation and fo the intenal ules of the institutions , which should be in confomity with it .
theefoe , M Baoso - and this of couse applies to the Council , too - in addition to the stuctual measues , we also need gowth .
the Commission should make sue that it has sufficient capacity fo this , as called fo by Paliament two yeas ago in its esolution on this issue .
this athe einfoces the pess epots , which give cause fo concen , that the Euopean Council has chosen a naow agenda fo the IGC and a meely voluntay chate .
I do not intend to outline the epot by the Euopean Monetay Institute , but simply to comment on thee athe impotant points which it aises .

what pogess is the Commission making towads poposing a standadised set of citeia fo the epoting of cimes and collection of statistics about cimes acoss the Euopean Union ?

if it is accepted , we shall have to send an amending lette fo next yea &apos;s budget .
I am glad to hea that the appoteu has vey much moved towads the amendment which the ELDR goup tabled .
as you can de@@ duce fom my explanations and the pesence of my colleague E@@ mma Bonino , the Commission is guided in these impotant health questions by a high level of consume potection , both on the intenal maket and in tade with thid counties .
M Pesident , Commissione , in ode to ende this instument effective , I would ask the Commission fo a sound wok pogamme - one that is both feasible and ealistic - and fo good coopeation with the Membe States .
infomation technology is aleady being taught and compute o@@ oms aleady exist in schools all ove Euope .
I would epeat what I said duing the pevious debate : as pat of ou innovation policy , we ae planning a seies of innovation patneships in vaious sectos , one of these being the aw mateials secto .
I believe that the ob@@ no@@ xi@@ ous wods of M Le Pen do him much moe ham than they do to democacy .
many of these olde fames ae at pesent subject to sca@@ emon@@ geing , with in@@ accuate infomation fom thei co@@ ope@@ atives .
a pefect example is the fan@@ tic ace fo output , poductivity and enlagement in ode to maintain an income that no longe allows pofitable investment .
the social patnes ae not tei@@ bly keen to ente into ageements .
it allows the poblem to be minim@@ ised . in fact it is immense .
I also agee that a possible hamonisation of these ciminal law instuments , which ae to be used as a last esot , is an especially impotant application of the pinciple of subsidiaity .
we must wok with them to find ways and develop initiatives which no longe make an appeal to civil and human ights seem an empty gestue .
I , too , want to wish him well in the wok he is going to do fo us in the Euopean Union ove the next six months .
it follows that Euope &apos;s weakness in its elations with Russia is caused by its own nai@@ vety and shot @-@ sigh@@ tedness .
ealy detection is vital , and we have seen when we have ealy detection that it is so impotant that many people ae still alive who would not have been if not fo ealy detection .
the Euopean Union also encouages Belaus to abolish o declae a moatoium on the death penalty .
as a esult , the numbe of ovedue diectives has hal@@ ved in the past yea .
Madam Pesident , the epot we ae discussing today is a vey impotant one , because the actual issue hee is to establish in advance what will subsequently be the appoach of the Community , the union of ou peoples , to futue development .
in Estonia , as in Latvia , although half the population is Russian o Russian @-@ speaking , the Russian language is not ecognised as an official language .
futhemoe , the popotion of live cattle to total expots has sh@@ un@@ k in ecent yeas fom 16 % to about 10 % .

that egion is impotant fo the Euopean Union fom seveal points of view : geo@@ politically , geo@@ stategically and also economically .
must I point out hee once again that since the 197@@ 0s , 200 000 jobs have been lost in this secto .
the combat@@ ants ae aleady in ou midst , and so nobody can ste@@ al away .
what is easonable is to appove the financial pespectives now , woking on the basis of the Luxemboug pesidency , and accept a eview clause duing the peiod of those financial pespectives ...
the epot on which you will vote today is based on a daft dating fom Apil of last yea .
at the same time , national govenments ae stongly tempted to put up baies to potect thei domestic poduction capacities .
I believe that intevention is necessay and that the lack of consistent data and infomation on investment pojects should be eme@@ died .
it is only ight that the Euopean Union should show solidaity when majo natual disastes occu .
what will we say when a pandemic occus ?
M Pesident , I believe it would have been bette to have held this debate befoe , and not afte , the Geneal Affais Council had ageed to the Community &apos;s offe fo negotiation of the agicultual aspects of the WTO .
the last point I wish to make is one of a pesonal natue with egad to Iaq .

in an aea that pemits feedom of movement , such as ous , the decisions taken by one Membe State will have an immediate effect on neighbouing counties .
ladies and gentlemen , the question we must ask ouselves today is one that we should in fact neve cease to ask ouselves , namely whethe the Euopean Union is a union of institutions , states , govenments and paliaments , o whethe it is a union of citizens , people and Euopeans .
in thei epot , the Expe@@ ts highlighted the non @-@ tanspaency which tain@@ ts ecuitment and ecommended that egulations and pinciples be applied to Community pesonnel .

the joint debate is closed .
I welcome the pagmatic appoach which has chaacteised these ealy contacts .
the Commission is awae that the diectives on public contacts have not been included satisfactoily by all the Membe States and also that , even if included , they ae often not applied coectly .
the Euopean Union , which - unfotunately , but it must be said - has been a most notable absen@@ tee fom the events that have con@@ v@@ ul@@ sed the fome Yugoslavia , must now adopt an active policy diected towads the econstuction of that egion , to encouage the etun of stability , peace and development to a egion so close to ou own .

M Pesident , I agee to a lage extent with the citical comments in the epot and M Gem@@ elli &apos;s poposals .
this is cetainly the case in the UK .

Membe of the Commission . - Madam Pesident , fist of all , I would like to thank all Membes of Paliament who dew my attention and the attention of my sevices to this impotant question .
in addition , and contay to the fist impession , the ejection of a patent application , in othe wods the efusal of patent potection , does not mean that all exploitation of the in@@ vention is excluded .
incidentally , I would like to say again to the Commission and the Council that although it is constantly maintained that this ageement will be highly significant as an additional means of combating teoism , the poof of this is not as clea as we ae always being told .
( applause )
we have blam@@ ed and accused EC@@ OS@@ O@@ C fo the facts that came to light and enough is enough .
Membe of the Commission . - In establishing the list we looked at the majoity of the pojects and we also involved the Membe States , so at this stage I have no eason to believe that we will be unable to dis@@ b@@ use o commit all the money .
the amendment by Ms Thyssen is natually close to ou heats because it efes to a goup which has eally been left in the lu@@ ch by the Council , despite geat expectations : assisting spouses .
M Pesident , M Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office , M Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , bom@@ bings in Isael , attacks on buses , in the maket , ae once again so@@ wing gie@@ f and death .
in coss @-@ bode cases , poblems incease because national enfocement mechanisms ae not designed to deal with such cases .
you point is noted and the Minutes will be amended .
I need say no moe , we totally suppot you initiative . the women of Kabul ae a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ o fo all counties in which human ights ae violated .
M Pesident , Ms Reding , ladies and gentlemen , Euope is to become , in the wods of the Lisbon and Stockholm declaations , the most dynamic and competitive knowledge economy .
futhe wok will of couse need to be undetaken when it comes to the final ageement , but fo the moment we simply need to be fee to define ou own position .
we , too , unanimously suppot the epot .
cetification of foests should seve as a means of communication between the poduce and the consume .
a efomed CAP with a ge@@ ene fist pilla , intoducing non @-@ contactual and annual envionmental actions that go beyond coss @-@ compliance , and a second pilla moe focused on climate action , suppoted by a pofessional fam advisoy sevice , could be tailo@@ ed towads helping fames to manage thei land @-@ use systems so as to contibute to climate action ( mi@@ tigation ) , and also become less vulneable to climate change ( adaptation ) .
if the head of the Commission is unable to take the action he thinks fit in espect of these officials , in the inteest of the Community , then it will neve be possible to establish a diffeent cultue .
I suppot this esolution in suppot of Chistians mudeed aound the wold , but nevetheless eget cetain omis@@ sions and in@@ consisten@@ cies .
even ou colleague M Cunha &apos;s poposal fo decoupling male beef but not su@@ ck@@ les in my county , Ieland , must come with a health waning , as it will collapse the pice of cal@@ ves and we@@ an@@ lings .
( the Pesident cut off the speake )
( Paliament appoved the Commission poposal )
( applause )
the final point is to look fo a solution .
( applause )
M Cunha &apos;s an@@ al@@ ges@@ ic poposals such as , fo example , the patial decoupling method , in othe wods making decoupling gadual athe than univesal , with fewe poducts in the fist yea instead of all poducts , evo@@ ke none of the above and , on a medium @-@ tem basis , they will have the same catastophic esults on the ual economy .
it is destoying lives and livelihoods .
theefoe we should exploit this potential of the Euopean budget to its limits .
amendment No 3 , which contains the poposal that action shall be taken in the event of conta@@ vention by licen@@ sed inspectos of the ules govening official exam@@ in@@ ations , can also be accepted in pinciple by the Commission .
this all aises big questions of pivacy and civil libeties , but it has been done in secet and with no democatic contol .
it is incompehensible that the committees should be shot of staff to cay out pepaatoy wok at the same time as legislation wok has inceased .
let us not fo@@ ol ouselves - until the Euopean Union bans them it will be impossible to take action against thid counties to pesuade them to des@@ ist .
Eitea has neve held a national election .
a numbe of lessons can be dawn fom these esults .
we do not want this to be mistaken fo potectionism , but we cannot ec@@ kl@@ essly give way on a fundamental issue just because we suppot N@@ el@@ son Mande@@ la and South Afica &apos;s stuggle to consolidate its anti @-@ acist democacy , which , as fa as we ae concened , has always been the goal , even though some of its most vo@@ cal defendes today wee peviously on the othe side , attacking Mande@@ la and the A@@ N@@ C .
of couse , it will also depend somewhat on the discipline of those Membes who speak , and the extent to which they espect thei allocated speaking time , which occasionally leaves something to be desied .
to this end , the Euopean Commission and individual publis@@ hes should ensue that disabled people ae povided with special digital vesions of woks , such as audi@@ o ead@@ ings .
. wok on the epot stated back in Apil 2005 and since then investigations have been caied out in the majo counties concened : Belgium , Denmak , Fance , Gemany , Hungay , Poland and the United Kingdom .
that is a ha@@ bit we must neve take fo ganted .
we cannot suppot tax cuts acoss the boad , and I find it egettable that this amendment is being teated as the most impotant .
the fea is , of couse , that opeatos will concentate on the most pofitable seg@@ ments of this maket and that is , vey often , not the odinay domestic consume .
the EU egulaly issues emin@@ des as to the decisive ole of the potection of intellectual popety in business competitiveness .
I shall immediately give the floo to the appoteu , M Boulanges , who , I believe , wishes to make a compomise poposal .
fom the point of view of the Euopean Paliament , the most impotant issue should be the non @-@ taiff baies , which has been emphasised many times at meetings of the Tade Policy Committee .
coopeation with the United States will be impotant fo the futhe development of tansatlantic elations .
I am still not satisfied , as you , M Baoso , have not esponded to ou questions concening REACH , fo example , which includes among ou policies a bold policy on chemical poducts , o to ou questions concening comitology , a baba@@ ity accoding political powe to the Commission and not to the epesentatives of the people , namely ouselves .
thank you , Ms Hem@@ ange .
the legislation should be subject to qualified majoity voting .
M Pesident , I must epot a vey seious matte cuently occuing in Italy .
we , and I pesonally , have on a couple of occasions asked the am@@ bassado and othe Russian epesentatives hee to allow us enty to Chechnya .
when that theat moves close and they must escape , we must eceive them .
the choice made at Helsinki to set up one of the fist units of a Euopean amy is heading in the ight diection and must be suppoted by Paliament , in the hope that the initiative will not stop at this fist step .
. - T@@ hat , honouable Membe , is an inteesting efeence to the cuent debate about the constitution .
do not lose hope about the Russians , but help them . howeve , the Russians must also estoe the confidence of the intenational community .
the discussion in the Council , it has to be said , is even wose .
the emegency pa@@ ach@@ utes that ae the escue plans need to be fol@@ ded away , they say , and investment pogammes abolished .
M Pesident , I wish to epeat my thanks and say that I hope that we will soon conclude the handling of this diective , which will allow the Committee fo Stan@@ da@@ dis@@ ation to cay out its wok coectly .
I thank you .
this is a matte whee both types of measue should be linked .
M Pesident , the Goup of the Paty of Euopean Socialists suppots Ms Dy@@ b@@ kj@@ æ &apos;s epot .
secondly , ae cetain epots coect in stating that the Council has aleady es@@ igned itself to limiting its objectives to a minimum , and to put off to a futue IGC the efoms that ae necessay to have an expanded Union which woks efficiently ?
WTO membes must emain committed to actively fighting potectionism .

last , but not least , I would like to point out , having just come fom the Committee on Employment and Social Affais , that we continue to be concened that coe labou standads and pinciples of human ights should not be shel@@ ved , and that they ae of geat impotance , paticulaly whee China is concened .
would the Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office be pepaed at least to convey to his Home Office colleagues my equest that an am@@ nesty be ganted to such couples , at least whee it is ecognised that thee is a genuine and sub@@ sis@@ ting elationship , and that the equiement to tavel to the county of oigin in ode to apply fo spo@@ us@@ al esidence be wa@@ i@@ ved ?
my thid point is that I will bing this esolution to the attention of my successo as the Commissione esponsible fo safety eseach , as I believe it to be vey impotant to make full use of the options available to us in this aea of eseach .
no othe Euopean pomise has been boken so often as the pomise of a fontie @-@ fee Euope .
( applause )
Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , thee may actually be anothe way of tackling these negotiations .
on the othe hand , howeve , it is impotant to guaantee fai tanspaency in aid distibution and guaantee moe esouces to States that actually need them .
take this epot .
also , with egad to the diective &apos;s scope and elevance , it seems that the diective is tou@@ ching the aviation business in one of its so@@ e points .
accodingly , we shall submit seveal amendments in the couse of this debate , and if those amendments ae not adopted we will vote against .
if that is the case , and if the confeence limits itself to making wondeful statements which will neve be followed up , I think that we must cancel it and the millions of euo that have been eamaked to oganise the confeence must be given diectly to the least @-@ advanced counties .
fo these easons , I believe that enegy efficiency epesents a pioity fo the futue of the EU , in both economic and envionmental tems , and I hope that the Commission will immediately take the necessay measues to implement the binding objectives that Paliament established today .
that means that a given egion will have its own logic fo majo pojects .
and Ms Ţ@@ ic@@ ău &apos;s question ?
moe than eve , this Afica deseves Euope &apos;s full attention .
we wee a few milli@@ metes fom ageement , when the Pesidency and the Commission had succeeded in getting most of the delegations to move kilometes , and that is eally something to eget .
it was all sti@@ t@@ ched up by the political goups - fai enough , pehaps .
I have been in this job fo just ove two yeas and what I am going to say does not suggest that all that has happened is because thee has been a new Commission - I am not suggesting that at all .
we all know that a common Euopean defence would cost a fai amount of money .
in the shot tem , this involves negotiating a famewok ageement between these two institutions to fom@@ alise coopeation between them and to con@@ fe the ole of oganising the implementation of the Union &apos; s space pogammes on the Agency .
eleven , the Membe States have to take the necessay measues to ensue that elations between shi@@ pp@@ es , fo@@ wading agents , main customes and sub@@ contactos ae egulated by the adoption of binding contacts which enable compliance with the egulation to be monitoed .
( the oal amendment was accepted )
coections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
thee ae also politicians who make sound pepaations and implement initiatives .
these places must be cheap and must not be accompanied by a eduction in women &apos;s income .
afte 1945 they lost thei libeties and oppotunities almost as soon as they had ega@@ ined them .
the sole question was whethe thee was a easonable chance of completing those negotiations with an acceptable ageement o not .
in witing . - ( GA ) Pat the C@@ ope Gallaghe MEP and Li@@ am A@@ yl@@ wad MEP have dawn attention to the fact that only Ieland and Malta use the system of popotional epesentation to elect Membes of the Euopean Paliament .
we could in this way also poceed in the ight way in COM efom .
duing the debate on the Matin epot in the House , Commissione Fischle made a speech in which he expessed views that wee contay to the inteests of Fench and Euopean wine gowing .
in othe wods , about one in fou of ou patients suffe damage because of the teatment and not because of thei disease .
and now the Council poposes a futhe eduction of allocations unde this heading .
( FR ) M Pesident , the acts of fan@@ atic ciminals , who have killed some Chistians in Egypt , cannot be as@@ ci@@ bed to an entie population and its govenment .
in the boade context , the Commission wants to establish , within ten yeas , a Euopean tax system compising taxes fo vehicle egistation and use , an intelligent picing system fo infastuctue and hamonised fuel taxes .
the delays in Membe States atifying the ageements appoved by the Council eveal the need fo the Community method even in mattes of the so @-@ called thid pilla .
secondly , M Pesident , I would ask that we put it on the agenda fo the next sitting , because it is an ugent matte .
the poblem elates to the detection of iegulaities by national contol agencies .
the EU can do much moe than just ene@@ wing sanctions on the egime .
appoximately half of the county is supplied fom gound wate souces ; the est eli@@ es on suface wate .
these pledges ae , M Méndez , like all pledges on mattes of detail , un@@ exciting , because eveyday life is not made up of impotant issues alone .
we ae gadually estoing Euope &apos;s integity and unity , einte@@ g@@ ating and e@@ uni@@ fying its cultue , taditions , peoples and childen .
I have in fact anticipated you wish . on behalf of this House , I have aleady witten to all the leades of the majo paties in Nothen Ieland to expess ou admi@@ ation fo what they have achieved and to send them ou best and wam@@ est wishes fo the favouable continuation of the peace pocess .
as the teatment of offen@@ des does not fall unde the powes of the EU , we have chosen to vote against the epot .
that is dealing with money efficiently .
today I also suppoted amendments which sought to make social and envionmental epoting obligatoy and suppoted the kind of efom of the CAP which would &quot; make povety histoy . &quot;
come and see what has been happening evey day fo the last ten yeas along the Italian coast@@ line ; come and see the conditions unde which we ae woking to eceive the people , not to put them in pison , and you will ealise how inadequate these poposed guidelines ae .
thee was also an oppotunity at the infomal ECOFIN to pusue the discussion on pepaations fo the intoduction of the euo . such discussions have been held at egula inte@@ vals .
well I must say that in this case this eally did not hamp@@ e in any way the swift adoption of a vey high @-@ quality and balanced legislative instument .
Membe of the Commission .
ou esponse to this issue has to be a joint one , based on solidaity .
documents defining development coopeation policy give no diections on which counties should eceive the aid .
having discussed the Budget 2000 in geat detail in Paliament and pa@@ ved the way so that in cisis aeas , such as the Balkans , thee is multiannual planning of funding , we must now gea ouselves to that pespective , instead of fit@@ teing money away on small , individual pogammes and pojects , which ae not conducive to efficient contol and whee moe is spent on staffing than on the objectives to be achieved .
in spite of the fact that we have only achieved a patial success , since the uni@@ tay patent potection system does not cove the entie teitoy of the Euopean Union , it should undoubtedly be egaded as a significant step fowad .
the Commission also welcomes the appointment by the UN Secetay @-@ Geneal of Pofesso I@@ bah@@ im G@@ am@@ ba@@ i as Special En@@ voy fo Myanma , and expects that the Govenment will extend its full coopeation to him , in ode to allow the good offices of the UN Secetay Geneal to continue .
an odinay cime has one o seveal victims .
unfotunately , he does not ente into a moe in @-@ depth explo@@ ation of this fundamental poblem egading Afghanistan &apos;s futue as a nation : this issue is subodin@@ ated .
it was with this in mind that M Baoso , whom you have aleady elected as Pesident of the Commission , eaffimed yesteday moning that the next Commission , evey bit as much as the pesent one , was committed to ceating a competitive Euope and to making the Euopean economy moe competitive .
Commissione Veheugen is also ight in saying that this phenomenon is not so much a consequence of paallel tade as of altogethe diffeent mechanisms which we need to tackle .
this ageement is not limited to mee financial compensation .
that is the extaodinay thing about the Thid Rei@@ ch ; the Naz@@ is wanted not a ta@@ ce to emain behind of the Je@@ ws of Euope .
the dimension that we in the Euopean Paliament and the Euopean Union need to bing to the matte is that concened with obseving the esul@@ tant ules - an aea to which this Paliament , the Commission and the Council can contibute .
I am opposed to enhanced Euopean coopeation .
if we talk about wate and the conditionality of pivati@@ sing the management of wate esouces , my eaction has been that fo a county like Bu@@ kin@@ a Fas@@ o the national esponsibility of the govenment thee to manage wate caefully and in the inteests of its citizens is as impotant - o moe impotant - a national pioity fo that county as the missile defence sh@@ ield is fo the govenment in Washington .
M Pesident , this House is about to pefom an act of geat couage and fa @-@ sigh@@ tedness .
we theefoe equest that the motion fo a esolution be attached to the statement , but not voted on until the next mini @-@ session in Bussels .
( PL ) M Pesident , public consultations on the Euopean Citizens &apos; Initiative have just ended , and it tuns out that the consultations atta@@ cted only 3@@ 23 espon@@ dents .
I must conf@@ ess that I cannot see any lab@@ y@@ in@@ th at my doo , I do not see any need fo Ai@@ ane &apos;s the@@ ad to get me away fom the min@@ o@@ ta@@ u and , of couse , fo that eason I voted against the censue motion .
I am all fo initiatives that will give Euopean fims , and in paticula small and medium companies , a flexible egulatoy famewok .
you also said that expenditue on agicultue would fall , while expenditue on sustainable business activity would ise .
this will mean that he o she is in possession of all necessay infomation and that EU officials will have to say what they know about something as opposed to what they want to say .
a question as impotant as this cannot be left to the Spanish alone .
it is ou fames who will suffe most , paticulaly in these cases .
we have often citicised the fact that the economic pilla is ove@@ valued compaed to the othe two .
as in pevious summits , the United States and ouselves will focus on concete successes which have been achieved in the last six months .
the fothcoming N@@ PT eview is an oppotunity that must not be wasted .
such popaganda and fai@@ y tal@@ es should no longe be spead hee , and the Euopean Union must make that clea to Russia .
suspen@@ sions and esevations often lead to the necessay impovements .
agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes
has it still not occued to you that , contay to the OECD philosophy which aims to ceate woking poo instead of unemployed people , thee is anothe stategy , which is followed by the ILO , the EC@@ E and the UN@@ DP , and which aims to encouage social and sustainable development ?
in paticula Labou MEPs welcome the call made fo the EU and US to wok closely togethe on a wide ange of common policy challenges ; the call fo the EU and US to place the Millennium Development Goals at the heat of intenational development policy is also one which Labou MEPs wholeheatedly suppot .
Sweden &apos;s Ministe of Justice has said that the action against intenational cime can be made much moe effective without having to amend the EU Teaties .
I make no b@@ ones about this .
suely the feeling of being Euopean elates fa moe to cultual efeences than to economic and social data ?
I hope that the Commission will give this poposal suppot and follow it up .
we must be paticulaly vigilant egading the constant challenge posed by the use of new online technologies - web cam@@ s , mobile phones and , in paticula , the use of the Intenet - in this egad .
she epeated the question as to how we guaantee that nothing like what happened with Euostat can ec@@ u , and that is the essential issue .
the fact is that actual economic conditions in the United States bea less and less elation to the dominant political dis@@ couse in Euope .
in ode to achieve this goal , the cuent Con@@ stuction Po@@ duc@@ ts Diective must be bought into line with the pinciples of bette law @-@ making .

- M Pesident , I must conf@@ ess that I have found it had to speak in this debate and I would , in fact , stat by ema@@ king that we must all bea in mind the wods of Ms Lulling .
a second poblem about which thee is too little talk is the oveall loss of competitiveness and the eve @-@ widening competition divide between the Noth and the South .
it is tue that the Commission is in favou of the cost of secuity and the po@@ tion of the pice esulting fom it being known .
we must , howeve , make conventional technology envionment @-@ fiend@@ lie - that is absolutely essential - and we must also ensue that conventional foms of technology become moe efficient .
the next 20 yeas will pobably see an incease of aound 80 % in the quantities of PVC waste because of the incease in the aveage li@@ fes@@ pan of cetain PVC poducts such as window fames .
if we do not give them this help and assistance , it will also be ou down@@ fall .
also , fo health claims based on newly developed data , the compomise now povides fo a simple and faste pocedue in ode to boost innovation in the aea of food .
I have noted the comments made about pesticides .
( a ) The dele@@ tion of a new &quot; sufficient &quot; classification intoduced and ageed upon in the Council duing the Iish Pesidency in June 2004 in Annex I
I wish to pay tibute to the memoy of the victims and also to the local authoity wokes , the emegency and medical teams , the Ele@@ c@@ tic@@ it@@ é de Fance employees and all the men and women who , with thei skills and goodwill , gave thei enegies to seve the geneal inteest .
Euope is clealy not just about the euo ; it is not just a single maket but much moe besides .
Madam Pesident , M Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , wheneve disaste stikes we ae faced with the same poblem : although pepaations ae made in advance fo aid pogammes , no maket eseach o opinion polls ae caied out among those hit by disastes , even though these ae key peequisites .
the attention of the wold &apos;s public opinion is focused on something else , on cetain attempts to ceate a nuclea powe in that county o on the clealy anti @-@ Sem@@ i@@ tic statements of the Pesident of Ian .
in poducing this poposal fo a egulation , the Commission has now ceated a legal basis .
M Pesident , line 15 05 55 is , I think , coveed by my ealie statement , so we do not have to vote on it .
yesteday &apos; s declaation by the Council is a positive sign but it is too late .
these link diectly to building tust , because such a system will enable us to see that eveyone is playing thei pat and will allow us to detemine the effectiveness of ou policies and how we should adapt them in the futue .
M Pesident , this poposal fo a egulation is beginning to look like a kind of am@@ nesty , a somewhat be@@ lated esponse to a poblem of vital impotance fo the elationship of confidence between poduces and consumes .
some new Membe States whose healthcae systems ae less ich@@ ly endo@@ wed could benefit fom this .
the Commission poposal ecommends that the aviation secto should not have to comply with the aveage fo the yeas 2004 to 2006 .
afte all , the poo status quo bought about these poposals afte initial epots showed the weaknesses .
all of that will be based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment of communication activities within the institutions .
this situation is not unique , it is going to happen again .
it is not acceptable fo the Commission to make decisions as a legislative body at the poposal of the Diectoate @-@ Geneal fo Com@@ petition on which it consul@@ ts Paliament , yet this is not the case fo ecommendations elating to the intenal maket .
as M Moillon will confim , the EU &apos;s election monitoing commission is staying put , and the UN is making its own consideable contibution .
the Euopean Union fli@@ es the flag of human ights and guaantees and , theefoe , when we establish this aea of justice , we shall do so esolutely , in the committee that I chai and in this Paliament , as fa as we can in this legislatue .
we have to emembe that Euopean society is vey much based on individual feedoms .
that will be a cucial test of whethe the EU is taking the Lisbon agenda at its face value , because the sevices secto is a main ese@@ vo@@ i fo apid economic gowth .
of couse the Committee of Inquiy could not accept this situation and has made a seies of ecommendations .
this is why it is essential that Euopol woks in conjunction with thid paty states since only then will its full effectiveness be ealised .
the vote will take place on Thusday at 11.30 a.m.
we all want to acknowledge that .
following the vote
in ode to be able to maintain this model , Sweden must be allowed a pemanent deogation as egads estictions on impots of alco@@ ho@@ lic be@@ ve@@ ages fom othe EU Membe States .
they want the intenal maket to seve them even bette in the futue .
because it is also illegal in any way to help homosexuals oganise themselves , lawyes and human ights activists ae also in dange of being affected , a state of affais that makes a debate on homo@@ sexual ights impossible .
( HU ) Commissiones , ladies and gentlemen , a lot has been said today about egional and cohesion policy .
whee this taffic is hal@@ ted tempoaily , it meets with potests fom those living in the vic@@ inity when it is allowed to esume .
I believe that Ms Muscadini is ight ; I advise those who do not know what things ae like in that aea and who need to be able to expess pecise opinions to go and see how things ae on the gound , by going eithe as a touist o fo othe puposes .
I hope that we will come to the ight decisions concening value @-@ fo @-@ money fo the citizens of Euope .
in the domain of suppot fo ual aeas , howeve , you will be voting on Thusday to detemine whethe you popose that the amount laid down in the financial pogamming should be exceeded .
outside the UC@@ ITS box , we ae looking at some of the new asset classes : pivate equity and hedge funds . these ae inceasingly poweful playes in Euopean financial makets .
I speak as the Pesident of the Foum fo Con@@ stuction in the Euopean Paliament .
Sch@@ leiche epot ( A5 @-@ 016@@ 7 / 2001 )
a decision to ef@@ und actual costs should come into foce automatically at the same time as a new Statute fo Membes is implemented .
Euopean citizens &apos; main concen is still about keeping thei jobs and ensuing a decent living .
howeve , in Sweden thee is gowing ii@@ tation about and citicism of childen &apos;s advetising .
we ae not thee to do that .
unfotunately , the financial losses of many ailines bea a athe obvious testa@@ ment to that because of the missed flights and the cow@@ ds that have been and ae still waiting fo a seat on the fist available flight .
the maket demands moden conditions unde which to opeate , including social secuity and potection fo the envionment and the consume .
fo a stat , the Euopean Union must at last wake up and do something about the mistakes that have been made hee , and the eason why it is the Euopean Union that must act is that it is the only political entity in a position to act as a medi@@ ato ; the Ameicans cannot do it - the wa in Iaq makes that impossible - and no can the Russians o any of the othes .
it is a highly ambitious task .
thee is no univesal legal solution fo this kind of de facto patneship o fo egisteed patneships o same sex mai@@ ages .
futhemoe , they povide potection against abitay actions and the abuse of powe .
can we ignoe the consci@@ ences of many Chistians simply because of the fact that today they ae in the minoity ?
this has been done in some cases , but not in espect of c@@ admium in feti@@ lis@@ es .
the Commission has also been vey well awae of the fact that an equilibium had to be found between the impotant data equiement and the minim@@ isation of the buden on espon@@ dents .
&apos;@@ D@@ ys &apos; -@@ type disabilities should be ecognised as specific conditions o im@@ pa@@ i@@ ments .
it is a union of values , and Tukey is now woking had and single @-@ minde@@ dly to adopt these values . pogess in Tukey is impessive and must be encouaged .
we theefoe need the common efeence famewok , because we need unifom standads in ode to build consume confidence .
a numbe of WTO mechanisms and pinciples un counte to this objective of sustainable development both socially and ec@@ ologically .
the new situation gives ise to new questions .
M Pesident , Commissione , I should like fist of all to congatulate the appoteu , M Galeote , on his highly detailed and substanti@@ ated epot .
only a small pecentage ae checked at the time of customs cle@@ aance .
all aspects of eseach and teaching must also have a moal dimension .
in conclusion let me say once again that the Council and the Commission must eliminate tax dumping in the Membe States once and fo all , as this also desto@@ ys job oppotunities .
a stong state is tageting its own people and is ceating as much scope as possible fo a new goup of entepeneus who , thanks to low wages and poo woking conditions , will get ich quick .
I thought we had submitted the names in time , but thee was some misundestanding .
howeve , it is impotant that we discuss how we can ensue that thee is moe spot in school .
we talk of not putting up baies at the stat of negotiations , and we do not mention that duing the pocess , when one jo@@ ins and the othe does not , much highe baies will be e@@ ec@@ ted .
the Stockholm Pogamme states that the EU must act in patneship and coopeate with thid counties ho@@ sting lage efugee populations .
the statement should also point out one of the impotant easons fo the economic and social cisis in Algeia , i.e. the lage debt which the Intenational Monetay Fund , amongst othes , is demanding that the county should e@@ pay .
of couse the whole pocess that we have now stated of consultation and dialogue with the Spanish Govenment on this paticula case means that we intend to get all the infomation necessay fo us to be well infomed about this pocess and to make sue that the Spanish Govenment complies with the legislation .
without altenative jobs in ual aeas young people will leave fo the cities and many moe people will comm@@ ute daily to towns and cities with all the negative implications fo the envionment of inceased ca use on inadequate ual oads .
it was the winne , not against Russia - which is a patne whom we espect - but in tems of affim@@ ing ou convictions and ideals .
with egad to waste wate teatment , Council Diective 91 / 2@@ 71 concening uban waste wate teatment foes@@ ees ules fo slaugh@@ te@@ houses .
the diectives that ae being discussed today ae impotant and , in my opinion , balanced .
Madam Pesident , it is cetainly tue that we ae adding ECU 115 million to the eseach pogamme as a esult of this epot , but that has to be seen in the context of the oiginal indicative figue of ECU 700 million .
Madam Pesident , the heat of Afica is tem@@ bling and qui@@ veing with violence , violence that claims moe victims , shif@@ ts national fonties and theatens counties with disin@@ te@@ gation .
in shot , it has been suggested that violence at football mat@@ ches sel@@ ls , it bings in a pofit .
I thank you , M Pesident , fo you ole and the wok you have done and would just like to join M Matens in saying that you ae indeed a though@@ tful , deeply committed and heatfelt Euopean .
this ensues that the epesentatives of the Austian people contol and help shape political negotiation in the Council , without the need fo a second chambe .
I am hopeful and confident that the Euopean Commission will now bing fowad the necessay legislative poposals to ensue that passenge ights fo the citizens of the Euopean Union ae geatly impoved as a matte of ugency .
the oiginal poposal was disappointing , and a lot of had wok has been put in to get the best deal possible fo fames in this egad .
M Pesident , on a point of ode , this Chambe may be soveeign , as you say , but it nonetheless must follow its own Rules of Pocedue .
in my view the &apos; phasing out &apos; suggested by the Commission is in itself a fai way of dealing with the egions that have eached the 75 % mak .
finally , I think we should be poud of one paticula matte whee the joint effots of Paliament and the Commission have met with success duing this peiod , namely in combating synthetic dugs .
all activities in the field of justice and intenal affais must be ooted in those common values .
what is moe , fom Mach of next yea the estictions that still exist on access to cetain aipots will be lifted : just think of He@@ a@@ thow , which only two Ameican ailines ae allowed to use at pesent .
but we do not manage vey well with 15 counties at the moment .
howeve , I have to ask whethe we ae all equal .
Paliament has poved itself capable of making such policy .
all of this shows the ugent need fo a Euopean immigation and asylum policy , and I welcome the wok done by the cuent Pesident of the Council with esponsibility fo this field , my fiend Bi@@ ce Ho@@ te@@ feu@@ x , the Fench Ministe fo Immigation , Integation , National I@@ denti@@ ty and mutually @-@ suppotive Development , who has just chaied the Euopean ministeial confeence on the ight of asylum on 8 and 9 Septembe 2008 in Pais .
the fothcoming Integovenmental Confeence will be no moe successful in solving it if it continues to wok on the same bases .
( PT ) The best way of combating media concentation at Euopean level is fo no intenal Euopean maket to be ceated .
it is theefoe my opinion that only by establishing egulations can we give the citizens and companies the secuity that a payment system equies .
Nations ae still divided by bodes .
howeve , thee is no panic and the isks ae vey limited .
M Pesident , 2001 is the yea in which the Commission is to daft a new common fisheies policy .
but the tuth is that we ely geatly on the Commission to come back to us with answes , and sometimes the quality , and indeed quantity , of the esponses at meetings is poo , I have to say ; not always , but in some cases it is not timely and we could do ou business a little bit bette .
good moning ladies and gentlemen .
this is a fom of human ights violation that is mainly encouaged by the govenment thee .
nonetheless , I feel it is impotant to make ou view known .
that has to be acknowledged once and fo all .
what effots has the Pesidency made to convince the Council to agee to the abolition of these guidelines and thus allow shop@@ pes to execise thei full single maket ights ?
this comment is intoleable .
fo this eason , I welcome the Thyssen epot of the Committee on the Intenal Maket and Consume Potection , which takes full account of this concen .
ou meeting at Mon@@ dof showed that all the Membe States wee ageed on consideing enlagement as a goup pocess fom which no applicant county should feel o be excluded .
ove the yeas , 5@@ 20 Chistian chuches and mon@@ astei@@ es have been systematically destoyed and eplaced by min@@ ae@@ ts .
the pesent Commission poposal not only e@@ vis@@ es and bings togethe vaious legislative measues but also c@@ loses a legislative loop@@ hole by coveing the envionmental effects of dangeous pepaations .
on the combating of oganized tafficking and cime , the plan povides that such coopeation could take the fom of egula exchanges of infomation , having due egad to national and intenational legislation on data potection , the setting @-@ up of a netwok of contact points and paticipation in semin@@ as .
Ms Wallstöm and M Byne have quite clealy come though thei exam@@ in@@ ations befoe the Euopean Paliament with flying col@@ ous .
if that is the case , if people ae locked up , o tanspoted illegally , on Euopean soil without any judicial tial , then the EU &apos;s vey coe values ae at stake and the question aises of what we intend to do about it .
I decided to suppot this ecommendation because I am convinced of the need to develop ageements with counties outside Euope .
this epot is a good example of why we should stand back and be sensible .
I believe that the egions should speci@@ alise in smat and geen developments and define fo themselves a set of innovation pioities based on the EU &apos;s objectives and thei needs , and channel Community esouces into these pioities which have been identified .
tomoow , following the meeting of the College of Commissiones hee in Stasboug , I will have the oppotunity to communicate the Commission &apos;s autumn economic foecasts to Paliament and to the public via the media , taking account of something we ae going to debate shotly , which is the clealy not positive , in fact negative , impact of the ise in oil pices we have been expeiencing ove ecent months .
I should like to make one additional point : I hope vey much that the Council will see fit to follow Paliament &apos;s example and in futue , when it is making amendments to legislative poposals , that it will also cay out an impact assessment .
I note today the Libeal Democat Amendment 58 to blame one side fo peventing a ple@@ bis@@ cite and the Consevative Amendment 5 to esist a ple@@ bis@@ cite in the futue .
again a wod on that , M Bösch . of couse , the Commission is the guadian of the Teaties .
moeove , seveal statements have been made about tax policy , an outstanding example of a policy that should take shape close to the people , that is to say in the Membe States .
M Pesident , I should like to close by saying that , in geneal , with a few exceptions , the amendments tabled by the appoteu have impoved the Commission &apos;s daft , but in this case , the epot &apos;s specific objectives ae fa less impotant than the mis@@ concep@@ tions undelying it .
passing on the views of the citizens of the Union is something which is quite appopiate in the Euopean Paliament .
following the eply to Ms Od@@ dy &apos;s question I have just noticed that nealy all of the issues tackled today , whethe at the level of statements , o though questions that ae put to me fo eply , deal with violence , teoism and non @-@ espect of human ights .
I believe that the solidaity between all Euopean counties epesented by the Euopean Commission is absolutely fundamental in this case .
it is obvious that in a competitive maket , infomation povision and pomotion measues fo agicultual poducts on the intenal maket and in thid counties ae becoming inceasingly impotant .
too many positions held ae maked by national inteests alone and ideological mind@@ sets .
these measues ae all in the ight diection .
befoe the final intoduction of the ban , we should assess the state of implementation of the diective , as an assessment of this kind could lead to poposals fo tansitional solutions fo the gadual withdawal of un@@ enich@@ ed ca@@ ges without putting poduces who have aleady complied with the egulations at a disadvantage .
this , in tun , suggests that we need a clea stategy , and hee of couse , we can coectly pactise this .
this has at least a double impli@@ cation . fist , Membe States ecognised that the Union needed to solve common poblems and common challenges .
when a county goes though such a cisis , it is vey difficult fo a govenment to follow good policies .
on countless occasions , this Paliament has come out in favou of impoving living conditions and human dignity with egad to vaious situations that sadly continue to be unde the ga@@ ze of intenational public opinion on a daily basis .
- ( DA ) We have today voted in favou of Ms Lambet &apos;s epot because , in many aeas , it impoves upon the minimum standads that , unde the auspices of the EU , an attempt is now unfotunately being made to establish when it comes to efugees and pesons with subsidiay efugee status .
we have aleady had a meeting with the sevices of the Ombudsman .
a new nuclea eacto is cuently unde constuction in Finland .
we believe that the Euopean institutions need to become moe tanspaent and accountable to the electoate .
it is five yeas since enlagement .
as a esult of action taken by the Lithuanian education authoities , aound 100 Polish school classes ae to be closed .

M Pesident , I am not going to speak about lob@@ stes , but I shae the inteests of the two pevious speakes .
M Pesident , Youth on the M@@ ove contains many encouaging initiatives .
howeve , we must undestand that , as a esult , we need to find a way of incopoating Switzeland into an oveall concept , that the dive@@ ting of taffic which is cuently taking place - and epesents some 30 % to 40 % of the taffic in my home county of Austia , especially in the Ti@@ ol - whee it still exists and has not aleady been tansfeed to ail , must be stopped .
we know that a Geen Pape on the povision of sevices of geneal inteest is cuently being pepaed .
these puchases alone amount to ECU 400 million , and it is a egettable fact that we cannot foes@@ ee these measues binging us out of the wo@@ ods , so to speak , and that futhe inteventions may well be necessay .
these ae vey delicate poblems and should be solved by each govenment at the closest possible level to the people in the famewok of the national democatic system .
a seious , scientific joun@@ al .
will they be tained to do so ?
Commissione , you once shaed with us a vision of how we would in futue be able to fly diectly fom A to B within Euope , thus enabling much bette use to be made of capacity , educing delays to a maked degee , adically minim@@ ising safety isks by , in shot ode , ceating a few functional aispace blocks in Euope , and putting an end to the pat@@ ch@@ wok in the sk@@ ies above Euope .
this Patneship Ageement between the EC and Mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que came into foce on 1 Januay 2007 fo a peiod of five yeas , and , compaed with the pevious ageement , it povides fo an incease of 2 000 tonnes in the Community fishing quota fo tuna o tuna @-@ like species .
cetain counties have the geatest possible inteest in finding methods of sepa@@ ating and sto@@ ing cabon dioxide fom the com@@ bus@@ tion of coal and oil . some counties ae pepaed to allow themselves to become dependent on natual gas fom Russia , while othes would athe pin thei hopes on nuclea powe , wate powe , wind and wave powe , biomass o geo@@ them@@ al enegy .
amongst othe easons this is due to the low efficiency of convesion of heat enegy into electical enegy , and also to logis@@ tical and envionmental poblems .
we Finn@@ s should now admit that the militay theat in Euope has geatly diminis@@ hed and secuity policy is based moe on ep@@ elling theats fom outside .
since intepetations of the judgments of the Cout ae not always unanimous , it is time to ceate a syn@@ thesis of all the vaious intepetations in ode to detemine clealy ou futue action .
Euope &apos;s decision @-@ makes and its paliament of elected epesentatives , meanwhile , must act togethe to pevent the emegence of povety i@@ v@@ aly , to pevent the economy and maket competition fom bul@@ l@@ do@@ zing the weak - childen , immigants , olde people , and families .
that was a decision I said that I would put befoe the Commission some weeks ago .
the egulation defines family benefits as those intended to compensate fo family budens and this definition was intepeted in a vey boad way by the Cout of Justice in the joined and cases .
that was a geat occasion , and I can only confim - as I think you will too - that fish ae a good thing .
nevetheless , despite this esevation , I shall suppot Ms Estel@@ a &apos;s epot because , economic consideations aside , not only ae thee men and women who must bette assume thei paental esponsibilities in a society that is inceasingly ab@@ dic@@ ating its esponsibility of aising its young people , but it is also ou duty to ensue that people do not have to choose to sacifice thei childen fo thei job , o thei job fo thei childen .
this is the main diffeence between Euope and the United States of Ameica , when it comes to SMEs , not because of specific legislation .
the gu@@ us of the An@@ gl@@ o @-@ Sa@@ x@@ on style libeal economy give lessons in pivatisation , maket laws , fee competition and othe li@@ tu@@ gi@@ cal instuments of the eligion of the &apos; in@@ visible hand &apos; .
we ae esolutely opposed to the spead of teoism , but pesonal confidentiality must be potected whee thee is no pio suggestion of wong @-@ doing .
the only poposal that we could add is that a system which can be vei@@ fied objectively should be woked out to define selection citeia which will ensue that each young peson has the same chance in all the applications in the vaious counties , egadless of the county they apply in .
while we have no poblem with this in substance , it would ceate substantial obligations on Community institutions and bodies and this cannot be done in the context of a diective .
without a definition of teitoial cohesion , which Paliament is waiting fo , the integated concept of economic , social and teitoial cohesion povides the futue basis fo EU egional policy and fo the Stuctual Funds &apos; fomat afte 2009 .
the sole aim is to lay off 24 wokes , 12 of whom ae tade unions epesentatives .
the vote will take place tomoow at 12 noon .
the Commission congatul@@ ates the Chi@@ lean and P@@ eu@@ vian Govenments on thei coopeation in the aest of M Fu@@ j@@ im@@ oi by the Chi@@ lean authoities , and of couse we would encouage the two govenments to continue to coopeate in this manne .
we shall ad@@ j@@ ou@@ n the debate at this point fo Question Time .
I did so quite voluntaily , because I pessed the wong bu@@ tton .
let us take it futhe , if we can , by extending it moe into the aea of consumes , and not just that of administative poblems .
the Commission will continue to do its pat to help achieve that aim .
they seek to cut compensation , but compensation suely ecognises the level of in@@ convenience , not the level of the fae .
I would like to stick to thee themes .
the Wold Bank is now tying , as some speakes also mentioned , to buy out the people who poduce these substances .
to conclude , I espect the amendments tabled .
I think it is incedible when even in my own goup Membes j@@ ump on this sot of band@@ wa@@ g@@ on .
othewise , we would be dis@@ especting the sacifices of the secuity foces , discou@@ aging thei actions and with@@ eing the popula spiit of especting the law .
. afte the teoist attacks in London on 7 July 2005 , the Council eiteated the ugent need fo an EU instument on etention of communications data , called fo in the wake of the Madid bom@@ bings , and made a commitment to agee to it by Octobe 2005 .
thank you , M Pesident .
at the same time , we call upon the Commission and Council to e@@ assess the policy of coopeation with Vietnam , beaing in mind that this coopeation should be subject to espect fo democatic pinciples and fundamental ights and efoms .
this Paliament is theefoe pleased that the negotiations have begun on a tade ageement between ou Union , the Euopean Union , and the Membe counties of the Gulf Coopeation Council .
the ju@@ y is out .
I would like to ask the Commissione whethe she would suppot an EG@@ T@@ C woking goup within the famewok of IN@@ T@@ ER@@ AC@@ T technical assistance and , if so , how this can be done .
I shall not go into any moe detail .
this means that tying to give ce@@ dence to the stoy that this is only an Italian affai ... I am soy , but that is a bit much .
the minoities who ae op@@ pessed thee include not only Hungaians and Co@@ ats , but also , sadly , Cze@@ chs , Gemans , Slov@@ aks , Poles and many othe nation@@ alities besides , who fo centuies fomed that pospeous min@@ ia@@ tue Euope that M Mei@@ je descibed so im@@ pes@@ sively just now .

these conditions may look vey demanding but they , epesent in fact , the mainsteam of shaed intenational policy in this aea .
those who want peace , want Euope .
M Pesident , Commissione , just imagine if the Euopean Union , in addition to the milk quota , wee to develop a multi @-@ annual pogamme fo mil@@ king machines .
this is causing eve geate poblems fo ou fames .
they put le@@ th@@ al dugs on the maket much ealie than the Membe States manage to ban thei sale unde national law , and among the people who buy them , the conviction aises that des@@ ig@@ ne dugs , because they have not been banned , ae not hamful eithe .
twenty @-@ fou hous late , people ealised they wee missing and they sent out a seach paty .
we cannot have electonic labels being applied to textiles without the knowledge of those concened whilst we ae still waiting fo the equ@@ isite labelling egulations .
futhemoe , infomation was made public ecently that the new national secuity doctine in Tukey will state that &apos; effots to ovecome the existing egime of the Pati@@ ach@@ ate and e @-@ open the Chal@@ ki The@@ ological Sch@@ ool must be esis@@ ted &apos; .
the fist is that we should ty to insist stongly on safe pa@@ king facilities fo loy dives .
it is pecisely in this diection that I would like to ask : &quot; at the existence of indicatos , at the definite existence of a vey seious initiative on the pat of the Euopean Commission concening oad safety in Euope , how is contol of the execution of these indicatos povided and in what way is it tuly guaanteed that we in Euope will have a eduction of fatal cases by at least 50 % ? &quot;
the Union has committed ECU 4.@@ 7 billion fo 1995 @-@ 1999 to assist the pocess of economic tansition now unde way .
we should , of couse , make intelligent use of such sanctions and taget them in such a way as to ensue that the lives of odinay Belau@@ si@@ ans ae not affected , but we should not hesitate to impose them , including the suspension of Belaus &apos; membeship in the Easten Patneship .
I suggest that the Euopean Paliament call on the Euopean Union and its Membe States to cay out the fight against teoism in full espect of human ights and fundamental feedoms as one of the main pioities of the Union and a key element of its extenal actions .
we ae inceasing ou effots in suppot of vulneable goups and in the fight against povety in Euope .

any victim of a epe@@ hen@@ sible act who eceives potection in a Membe State of the Euopean Union should be able to enjoy the same potection when he o she tavel@@ s to anothe Membe State .
on this point , the Euopean Paliament is fankly making a mistake in demanding an eve geate communi@@ ti@@ sation of the poject , fo example in estim@@ ating , in its esolution of 17 Januay , that &quot; The ES@@ A with its basis of integovenmental coopeation should in the longe tem be bought within the EU &quot; .
I think we all want to see the human ights situation impoved .
as epesentative of a lage women &apos;s association , I still seiously question whethe double labelling - i.e. a egional and a Euopean quality mak - eally will pesuade people to pay highe pices fo foods poduced unde moe stingent ules .
the next item is the joint debate on the Council and Commission statements on climate change .
it is the ule that those things that ae subject to codecision should be dealt with at the beginning of a vote .
how was it possible fo OLAF &apos;s communication to the Commission &apos;s Secetay @-@ Geneal to have been so secet that the Commissiones did not eceive these communications ?
we need to espond to this situation , not only with an exit stategy , but with a medium @-@ tem stategy so that this decade is one of gowth and employment .
all the measues adopted by the govenment demonstate that the Democatic Libeal Paty in Romania is at wa with the entie Romanian people .
to that end , the Pesident of the Euopean Council will go to Moscow on 8 Septembe , accompanied by the Pesident of the Commission and the High Repesentative .
hence the petext that the own esouces ceiling is s@@ aco@@ san@@ ct until 2006 .
what sot of coheence do we have when , on the one hand , we insist on solidaity and , on the othe , fail to make the necessay financial esouces available ?
what does the Commission have to say about democatic and judicial contol ?
waiting until 2015 to substantially educe CO2 emissions fom vehicles is highly iesponsible .
M Pesident , it has been had , but it has been woth the effot ; we ae finally being head in this House .
at the same time , the in@@ adequacy of the Union &apos;s aangements fo ensuing tanspaency and democatic accountability in the activity of the Euopean Cental Bank has become appaent .
we can then eally help people who want to implement pojects but do not have the necessay stat @-@ up capital .
I believe that it suffes fom excessive complac@@ ency in elation to the govenment in Colom@@ bo .
I also want to daw the Commission &apos;s attention to Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 18 - as well as pat of Amendment No 9 - which define the scope of esale ight to exclude man@@ us@@ cip@@ ts , but deal with esale ight in a wok which has a cetain oigin@@ ality and is intended to be viewed .
we ae opposed , howeve , to those pats of the epot which concen a complete hamonisation of diect taxes .
moe geneally , the newly established EU @-@ China woking goup on IP@@ R will concentate on concete business issues .
a ecent study by the UK Depat@@ ment fo Intenational Development has estimated that 150 million people - one @-@ eigh@@ th of the wold &apos;s pooest - egad wil@@ d@@ life as an impotant livelihood asset .
povisions should also be laid down fo online sales , including the intoduction of an EU cetification lo@@ go , a centalised database at national level listing all authoised e@@ tailes and sevee penalties fo taffickes in illegal poducts .
do we need bette chemicals legislation , an impoved substitution pinciple , moe effective ules , moe ules , moe contols and moe altenative poducts ?
the aveage income pe peson in such families is usually significantly lowe than in the families of single mothes .
the situation on the Koean pen@@ insula is potentially fa moe dangeous than in Iaq .
as to how egulation is to be implemented , thee is a choice between , on the one hand , a voluntay ageement of the industy based on ageed objectives and , on the othe hand , the conventional legislative oute .
I also have confidence that the Commission will take this esolution to heat and that the Commission and the Council will now get to wok on this matte .
we see the new neighbouhood policy , in its cuent set @-@ up , is an inadequate match fo what is developing ove thee .
the Euopean Union encouages thei development .
my thid and final point is this : I think the epot is good but I think we could go even futhe .
the next item is the Commission &apos;s communication on the follow @-@ up to the Cout &apos;s uling in C@@ ase C / 10@@ 6 ( legal bases in the budget ) .
by the same token , now that pogess in child psych@@ ology has explained to us thei emotional and intellectual needs , how can we accept that thee ae moe and moe childen who ae abused , especially within thei own families .
this compomise takes into account the diffeent comments made by all the actos in this affai since 1993 .
let us say to them clealy that ovely estictive measues have pev@@ ese effects , and often have the opposite effect because they encouage illegal behaviou - the souce of all sots of pesonal da@@ mas and political difficulties .
we should be helping the citizens of Noth Koea to suvive the fam@@ ine , not to build a load of nuclea powe stations .
in the nea futue , the Commission is due to adopt a geneal plan fo humanitaian aid to Iaq woth ECU 20 m .
closing down factoies cannot be nomal .
we ae detemined to play a full and constuctive pat in making the launch of economic and monetay union a success .
the fishemen ae apidly losing any espect they eve may have had fo this dis@@ cedi@@ ted policy .
I am well awae that we will be having seious political debates .
it will have epecussions on the Euopean Data Potection Diective that is shotly to be evised , on the data potection diective fo electonic communications and on the fo@@ wading of Pas@@ sen@@ ge Name Data that is being negotiated by Ms in &apos; t Veld .
the Slovenian and then the Fench Pesidencies must wok with Ieland to ty to find a legally acceptable solution that would put an end once and fo all to moe than 15 yeas of effots to efom the wok@@ ings of the enlaged Euope .
in my view , the appoteu is too optimistic if he believes that poblems of this kind can be avoided completely by stepping up contol .
that is why I wish to emphasise once again the advantages en@@ tailed by this choice and , hence , the benefits to be had fom it .
the discussions have been intensive , complex and have often povo@@ ked stong emotional eactions and divided opinions .
I pesonally am in favou of its substance , and , like the majoity in this House , I also voted in favou of it at fist eading stage , but the Council could not be pesuaded to accept it .
a common egulation is equied at Euopean level , a egulation based on consume potection and focused on pevention , to pevent the development of addiction , the association of online gambling with oganised cime , and the match @-@ fixing scandals jeopadising fai play .
when , howeve , the Diectoate @-@ Geneal fo Com@@ petition suppots the town of Chal@@ eo@@ i &apos;s giving geneous subsidies to the ailine R@@ yan@@ ai , I believe that it must be citicised because that kind of action disto@@ ts competition between towns , between businesses and between modes of tanspot in a way that is detimental to the Lisbon and Gothenbug policies .
I need to have a fank conves@@ ation with you .
the leades of these thee counties ae giving odes to fie on thei own people , who ae legitimately demanding political feedom , human dignity and social fainess .
( PL ) M Pesident , acting as you did ealie I would like fist of all to congatulate M Z@@ al@@ es@@ ki on such an in@@ sigh@@ tful epot concening tade and economic elations with Ukaine .
the United Nations must , moeove , opeate bette and become moe efficient in ode to adapt to the new cicumstances . fom the founding spiit of the San Fan@@ cis@@ co Chate to the twenty @-@ fist centuy , fom 60 nations to 190 , fom colonial egimes to independence and fom the fall of the system of blo@@ cs to today &apos;s globalised wold .
it is unfotunate that the Commission is foeve putting sp@@ ann@@ es in the woks .
accepting a secula state whose population is lagely Islamic would enhance that pinciple .
in late 2001 and ealy 2002 , the Geneal Secetay of the United Nations will have a last chance to make a beakthough in inte@@ community negotiations .
when I listened ealie to Luxemboug &apos;s epesentative , I was vey concened , as I think it impotant that the Council &apos;s epesentative should , in all situations , speak up fo full human ights and the ight to a fai tial .
in this situation , many Membe States ae quite simply ove@@ buden@@ ed .
moeove , tials ae scientifically beneficial , since the eseaches involved can publish and discuss the findings of thei expeiments and in that way futhe thei ca@@ ees .
but we ae in dange of da@@ sh@@ ing expectations .
would the chance of a little cha@@ ity not help ?
the poduces must have at thei disposal a sufficient quantity of active substances in ode to effectively and safely combat any disease o pest affecting thei plants , beaing in mind that often the dange lies not in the poduct itself but in its misuse .
the vote will take place duing the next monthly session .
as a consequence , not only did we gain the suppot of 90 % of the membes of the Committee on Legal Affais and the Intenal Maket , but we wee also able to ensue that the poposal as a whole is now moe balanced and shows the human face of the intenal maket .
on the basis of paagaph 12 , theefoe , I vigoously condemn this unilateal element in Fench policy . it is not , at the moment , the only one .
the amendments appoved in the Committee on Agicultue sought to e@@ establish that vey balance .
I believe that we eally now have to embak on this poject without delay and ensue that Russia does actually see the atification of this ageement though to the end .
instead of spu@@ ing on the social patnes , the Membe States should ensue that they implement and pomote the pinciple of equal teatment , and thus do what EU teaties and legislation pesci@@ be .
cultual and linguistic divesity is a souce of immense wealth in Russia , and we hope that it will be exploited bette than it is now , and moe than it is now .
the mechanisms fo einfocing the competitiveness and convegence of the Euopean economy , which apply not just to the 17 cuent membes of the euo but to all the 27 , will be ceated with due espect fo the Teaties - that is , fo the competences of the Union and of its institutions and , in paticula , the competences of Paliament and the Commission .
today wold politics is fist and foemost about gas and oil .
each m@@ am@@ mo@@ gap@@ h must be ead independently by two adi@@ olog@@ ists .

I hope the esults of the Bali Confeence , in Decembe , will send the optimistic messages which we ae all hoping fo .
the FAO ecently waned that bid flu is likely to be caied to the Middle East and Euope by mig@@ ating bids .
should we not fist addess the stuctual causes of povety ?
the Membe States must define the obligations of public sevices in detail : those obligations must be objective , tanspaent , they must not ceate discimin@@ ations , and they must be vei@@ fiable .
ae you not slightly emba@@ assed , M Michel ?
( DE ) M Pesident , M Baoso , M Rein@@ feldt , you calm and steady Pesidency was a success .
the geate pat of these objectives ae shaed and upheld by the cuent Pesident of the Commission , M Baoso .
the fact that we ae also debating global food secuity this week is theefoe ich@@ ly ion@@ ic .
to cl@@ one people would be hoific , a violation of human dignity , an attack on the individu@@ ality and integity of man .
both of them should apply pagmati@@ sm to ensue that a stong , effective , coheent diplomacy can be ceated acoss the be@@ ad@@ th of policy .
global waming is one of the most complicated issues which the whole planet is facing .
this is all I can say to the honouable Membe on the subject of Eu@@ one@@ ws at the moment .
( applause )
theefoe , while the quality standads fo the sufficient categoy ae fa too stingent , the Commission could accept the pinciple of the amendment .
that is my question .

the economic cisis is aleady affecting the population diectly , while unemployment is on the ise in developing counties .
it is absud , egadless of the legal techni@@ c@@ alities efeed to by the Commission .

finally , I want to ecall that , should no new ageement be in place on 1 Octobe , ai caies flying fom Euope to the United States isk legal complaints fom citizens based on divegen@@ t national legislation on the tansfe of PNR data to the United States .
I guaantee you that , in 2012 , we will be having a evised and extended vesion of the discussion that we had this yea , because a minoity of govenments , led by the United Kingdom , believe the cuent Euopean budgets to be excessive : they want less , they do not want moe .
he fo@@ gets that democacy in Taiwan , which is a Chinese county , is woking bette and bette .
it has been a demanding dialogue , a ich dialogue , with genuine inteaction on both sides .
the main objectives which the Commission tied to attain in the implementation of its White Pape seemed laudable : developing employ@@ ability and boosting knowledge potential .
I attach paticula impotance to this , specifically in tems of the measues which need to be taken to ceate the ight oveall famewok .
Madam Pesident , we ae dedicated , as a Euopean Paliament , to potecting the envionment .
we have to set an example to the taxpaye , the odinay Euopean citizen , and show that we can also take esponsibility fo economic mattes .
in a futue EU with a common secuity policy , Membe States without nuclea weapons could un@@ inten@@ tionally be dawn into conflicts involving such weapons .
we also note that often , the death penalty is caied out by ston@@ ing fo cimes as mino as allegations of adul@@ tey and a@@ pos@@ tas@@ y .
this epot contains some constuctive poposed changes to these measues wheeby , fo example , esouces paid out fom Community funds would be monitoed moe efficiently and such funds not used fo elocation within the EU .
thee is a saying in Finnish that wa is not dependent on one man .
afte all , othe Membe States of the Union fully suppot the stance adopted by Paliament and the Commission .
as fa as supevision is concened , I agee with those hee who have demanded that the level of supevision be compaable thoughout Euope and that it is not sufficient to have a woking system of supevision in Geat Bitain alone .
the Commission believes that Euope should lowe the costs of clean enegy and put industy at the foefont of the low @-@ cabon technology secto .
what we also see is that the egulations ae inadequate .
howeve , if a substance pesents no health isks , because it is in@@ accessible , say , then it may not be pohibited .
the success of a Pesidency , Pime Ministe , is geneally inves@@ ely popotional to the size of the county .
M Pesident , ealie we voted in favou of the epot by M Maaten on tobacco poducts , which contains some excellent measues .
secondly , thee is a need fo moe questions to be put on the agenda fo the Summit , one , fo example , being that of how a consistent fight against povety , unemployment and social exclusion can be waged in tan@@ dem with an effective fight against global waming .
U@@ NA@@ ME@@ T ae tying thei utmost to potect the people but the mili@@ tia goups ae still active .
this will help to win back the confidence of Euope &apos;s citizens in beef .
you fo you pat , at the Commission , should implement and test the measues ageed and then einto@@ duce them into the negotiations .
given the cuent economic and demogaphic situation in Euope , the impovement of the economic and social status of the Roma can open up new human esouces , thus contibuting to economic gowth in the long un .
the wold has wat@@ ched in ama@@ ze@@ ment , both at the immense flow of gas and oil fom the up@@ tued pi@@ pe following the explosion and disaste in the Gulf of Mexico and at the seem@@ ing inability of both the industy and the US authoities to stem the flow ; we must hope that ecent developments will pove successful .
the goundwate potection and the ni@@ tates diectives should be well implemented to potect in the best way possible the poducts poduced by the faming industy .
unde the gu@@ ise of adaptation to the digital envionment , the Commission has intoduced confusion into the Euopean system of autho &apos;s ights and elated ights .
two yeas ago , aid fom the EU Membe States to industy that poduced and used had coal , that is to say , an@@ th@@ aci@@ te , was as much as EUR 2.@@ 9 billion .
Madam Pesident , the pomotion of a sustainable wokfoce fo health acoss Euope is cucial in continuing ou impovement in healthcae sevices and facilities acoss the 27 Membe States .
the appoteu consides that this is indeed an impotant piece of the pu@@ zz@@ le in the EU enegy policy , easoning that we cannot effectively pomote a Euopean enegy policy at EU level without having adequate infomation about ou enegy infastuctue .

fistly , we need to take into account all the inhabitants of this continent , both the sick and the healthy .
whethe they will o not , we cannot be cetain at this point in time .
Madam Pesident , on a point of ode , I just want to make an obsevation and I know many Membes would agee with me .
we will all need to ebuild ou sc@@ ales of values in tems of ou salaies and ou daily expenditue .
and finally , it is impotant not to play off lage fams and small @-@ sized poduces against each othe .
on the one hand , Euope has to safeguad its enegy supply and educe its dependence on foeign impots .
a second subject is eco@@ veies - a tuly tim@@ eless one , to judge by the Euopean Cout of Auditos &quot; latest epot .
we must distinguish between these two situations .
we have talked about this to the emin@@ ent epesentatives of the Committee on Legal Affais as allies on seveal occasions .
high @-@ quality meat and meat beaing a seal of quality will have the equied infomation on its label , nomally in the fom of a code athe than a pin@@ ted name .
amendments have been submitted in dupli@@ cate o ti@@ pli@@ cate , and contadictoy amendments have also been tabled to the same Paagaph .
you see , I would now like to execise one of the geat achievements of ou Euopean continent .
M Pesident , the Teaty of Nice tends to be make@@ ted as an enlagement teaty .
it is now only a matte of time until such a pape dicta@@ tes that the Bitish will dive on the ight hand side !
the judgment is in@@ valid because the egional cout in Mun@@ ich dis@@ missed the action against To@@ bi@@ as Pf@@ lü@@ ge on 21 July 2009 in the second and final instance .
well , because , in moden was and conflicts , the geat majoity of the victims ae innocent women and childen .
on that issue , we have been athe anxious since Monday , since you pesident , M Baoso , made his statements asse@@ ting that the envionment and the stategies elated to it ae too costly .
befoe the 1992 efom of the common agicultual policy , the epot on agicultual pices was one of the most sought @-@ afte and most pesti@@ gi@@ ous epots .
I uge these counties to seize this chance to futhe speed up thei pepaations .
- M Pesident , my political goup will not be voting in favou of the Bok epot , mainly fo the following easons :
if thee is no mutual tust and if the necessay infomation is not made available to Euopol and Euojust , the Euopean stategy is matei@@ ally weakened .
since the failue of the Council of Ministes on telecommunications on 28 Novembe , we have been faced with a constitutional poblem .
on behalf of the Vets / ALE Goup . - ( SV ) Thank you , Commissione .
subject : le@@ ctues &apos; conditions of sevice in the UK
I should like to thank the autho of the epot , the committee and all the Membes who have contibuted to this vitally impotant discussion on policy concening the disabled .
smoking causes enomous health poblems within the population , both of smo@@ kes and non @-@ smo@@ kes , and I know that some colleagues feel that the use of s@@ n@@ us is a bette altenative .
today &apos;s poposal fo a diective is basically no diffeent fom the pevious one .
leave that step to the Council ; you should defend a Euopean Union , with its policies , pioities , esponsibilities , and an adequate budget .
I would eally like to avoid a debate .
thee will be cultual and political divesity , but also teitoial divesity .
Regulation at EU level of the poblem of unfai pactices used by the lage etail distibution cha@@ ins against poduces is vey impotant fo Romania .
( Paliament decided to vote on the matte )
fo this vey eason , in the decision of 3 July 2006 that is alleged to contadict what we have done - in fact because of that decision by the Committee on Legal Affais - we have confimed the election of M Oc@@ ch@@ et@@ to , because at the time the poc@@ lam@@ ation was in confomity with the Euopean Act , in that we ecognised his withdawal to be in@@ valid , impo@@ pe and n@@ ull and void .
agicultual expenditue is to incease by no moe than 0.@@ 45 % , although unde the Inteinstitutional Ageement , the figue should have been 2.@@ 1 % .
each Membe State of the Union ought to be able to decide fo itself whethe o not to intoduce genetically modified oganisms on its teitoy .
I would like to ask all colleagues to please keep quiet so that we can wok fo 10 moe minutes and finish this impotant epot and impotant wok .
we should not feed the adic@@ alisation of exteme Palestinian oganisations any moe and Isael beas a geat deal of esponsibility hee .
indeed , that is the only way of inceasing the pesonal esponsibility of inspectos , in case of faud o manipulation of inspections .
we theefoe completely agee with the geneal comments made by Andé Sa@@ in@@ jon and the amendments poposed by the Commission on Extenal Economic Relations .
the foeseen pice cut only ki@@ cks in fo the ACP counties in 2008 , two yeas afte it is imposed on the Euopean fames .
this spiit , this oveall balance einfoced by the vote in committee , must guide tomoow &apos;s vote in plenay .
they see the esale ight as being a majo economic disadvantage , because it will inevitably lead to a dop in the initial sale pice .
